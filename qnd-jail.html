<h2>The Quick-N-Dirty Guide to Jails in FreeBSD</h2>
</center>
Please note.  Lately, I have begun using the ezjail program to manage
jails.  I'm leaving this page intact, as I hope people may find it
useful, but recommend that the reader wishing to run jails on FreeBSD
use our <a href="qnd-ezjail.html">ezjail guide</a> instead.  
<p>Recently, I had to set up an apache server within a jail.
Although the jail man page is quite good, there were a few tricks
here and there that cost me some googling time. Remember, the qnd
in our name stands for Quick 'N' Dirty so this is not going to be
an exhaustive treatise on jails.</p>
<h4>1.) Do you have jail?</h4>
At a command prompt type
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
which jail
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>You should get back the answer /usr/sbin/jail. If not, something
is probably seriously wrong with your system. The jail program is a
part of the basic FreeBSD system.</p>
<h4>2.) Installing, Configuring and Testing Your Jail</h4>
In my case, I decided to put my jail in /usr. For purposes of
example, we'll say I have a machine called host.mydomain.net. On my
home network, it has an IP address of 192.168.7.50. The interface
is fxp0. I'm going create a jail in /usr/jail, give it hostname of
jail.mydomain.net and an IP address of 192.168.7.60.
<p>So, first I look at the jail manpage which gives
instructions.</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
man jail
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>I suggest that you do the same. After reading the instructions,
I do the following.</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
D=/usr/jail
cd /usr/src
mkdir -p $D
make world DESTDIR=$D
make distribution DESTDIR=$D
mount_devfs devfs $D/dev
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>As you can imagine, it takes a bit of time to do the make world.
However, eventually this finishes and I have a virtual server in
/usr/jail.</p>
<p>The man page then suggests adding various things to
/etc/rc.conf. Following a page on <a href=
"http://www.freebsddiary.org">the FreeBSDdiary site</a> I didn't do
this. There are various issues which I'll deal with shortly.</p>
<p>The next thing I wanted to do was a bit of configuration with
the jail. So, still going with the man page I started a shell in
the jail. At this point I haven't yet configured the jail's rc.conf
however, using the made up hostname and IP address are necessary
for the next step.</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
jail /usr/jail jail.mydomain.net 192.168.7.60 /bin/sh
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This puts me in the jail with a sh shell. (It will also temporarily
set the jail's hostname to jail.mydomain.net). There are several
steps recommended by the man page. First, I create an empty fstab.
I just type</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
vi /etc/fstab
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>That opens up a file with nothing in it. Then I save the file
with :x or :wq, or whatever I wish to use to close vi. Next, I edit
the jail's rc.conf. I use vi, you can use ee or whatever. You have
a fully functional FreeBSD system in this jail, so both are
available. Actually</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
touch /etc/fstab
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>would have done the same thing and been more efficient. I add
the following to jail's /etc/rc.conf</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
rpcbind_enable="NO"
network_interfaces=""
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The man page says to then run newaliases. If you do, you get an
error message but I do it anyway. :) I then copy over
host.mydomain.net's /etc/resolv conf to the jail. (I can do this
from the host machine, not from within the jail) So, while logged
on to host.mydomain.net</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
cp /etc/resolv.conf /usr/jail/etc/
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Then, back in the jail, I set a root password, different than
the password on host.mydomain.net, configure the timezone and add
any users. In my case, I want to add a user called john, who will
belong to the wheel group, so that he can perform any maintainance
necessary. I might have user john on host.mydomain.net, and again,
I'll use a different password on jail.mydomain.net. One can, while
in the jail, run /usr/sbin/sysinstall and go to the post install
configuration menu to do the timezone (and other aspects of
configuration).</p>
<p>The whole purpose of this jail is to run a webserver. So, while
within in the jail, I add apache. I can install the ports
collection, (which is not in the jail by default) but in this case,
I'm just going to use pkg_add. I'm also going to add bash, as I
prefer a Bourne style shell, and the installed sh doesn't have tab
completion. I'll also add sudo, so that john can do everything
without having to su to root while in the jail.</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pkg_add -r apache21 sudo bash
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Next I configure apache. This is about jails, not apache, but I
do add a line to start it in jail's /etc/rc.conf. I move my web
pages to /usr/jail/usr/local/www/docs, edit my
/usr/jail/usr/local/etc/apache21/httpd.conf and I'm basically set.
I add the jail.mydomain.net entry to /etc/hosts. I keep it as
simple as possible, and as this works, all I do is add the line</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
127.0.0.1       jail.mydomain.net       jail
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>to jail's /etc/hosts.</p>
With recent changes to the way rc.d scripts work, one may also have to
add the following to the jail's /etc/rc.conf
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
early_late_divider="NETWORKING"
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
If that line isn't in the jail's rc.conf then some programs that run
from the jail's /usr/local/etc/rc.d may not start properly at boot.
<p>Now, I exit out of the jail. I'm ready to restart it. I have a
few things to do, as you'll see. We have to set the alias on
interface fxp0, mount procfs on jail's /proc and then we begin.
Note that I am back in host.mydomain.net, not in the jail, as I do
the following.</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
ifconfig fxp0 inet alias 192.168.7.60/24
mount -t procfs proc /usr/jail/proc
jail /usr/jail jail.mydomain.net 192.168.7.60 /bin/sh /etc/rc
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>We also want to edit host's /etc/ssh/sshd_config. You'll find a
line</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>That means it's listening on all interfaces. If, even after
setting an alias for the jail, you then try to ssh into the jail,
you'll wind up in host.mydomain.net. So, we want to change this.
Remember host is 192.168.7.50 and jail 192.168.7.60. So, we want
host's ssh daemon to only listen on 192.168.7.50. Edit the line to
read (and don't forget to remove the # from the front of it)</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
ListenAddress 192.168.7.50
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Restart the sshd daemon, with a kill -SIGHUP or using
/etc/rc.d/sshd restart or whatever you prefer. I should now be able
to open a web browser to 192.168.7.60 on my home network and be
able to browse the website I've created in
/usr/jail/usr/local/www/doc.</p>
<p>One can check the jail and its Jail ID with the command</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
jls
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The ordinary shutdown commands don't work within a jail. To kill
it you can while in the jail use</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
kill -KILL -1
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>or</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
kill -TERM -1
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>To kill the jail from host.mydomain.com you can use the jexec
command. First run jls to see the Jail ID. You might get something
back like</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
JID   IP Address       Hostname             Path
2     192.168.7.60    jail.mydomain.net     /usr/jail
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Now, you use jexec with the the JID</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
jexec 2 kill -TERM -1
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>You can then run jls again, which should show you that nothing
is running.</p>
<p>While testing, I simply use a script to start jail. If all you
wish to do is run apache, you don't have to mount devfs on
/usr/jail/dev. The problem is that if you don't, you won't be able
to ssh into the jail. However, as the jail manpage points out, you
don't wish to mount the entire devfs on /dev because it opens up
various vulnerabilites, possibly giving someone access to, for
example, your hard drives. The jail man page sends you to the devfs
manpage which has a few examples. While testing and using the
script, I mount only enough so that I can ssh into it. I simply
apply rules on the fly in the script</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
sudo ifconfig fxp0 inet alias 192.168.7.60/24
sudo mount -t procfs proc /usr/jail/proc
sudo jail /usr/jail jail.mydomain.net 192.168.7.60 /bin/sh /etc/rc
sudo devfs -m /usr/jail/dev rule apply hide
sudo devfs -m /usr/jail/dev rule apply path null unhide
sudo devfs -m /usr/jail/dev rule apply path random unhide
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Once everything is working, I add various lines to /etc/rc.conf
so that the jail will work upon reboot. There is already a default
set of jail rules for devfs in /etc/defaults. It's part of the file
/etc/defaults/devfs.rules. There is also a jail_list mentioned in
man rc.conf that we can use for conveniently naming our jail. In
this case I'm going to call it ujail, but I could name it Frank if
I felt like it. There are some defaults that one can view in
/etc/defaults/rc.conf. I'm going to set this jail so that root in
the jail can't change the hostname. I'm going to add a devfs entry
as well, so that I can ssh into the jail.</p>
<p>I'm also going to set the alias for the fxp0 interface, so that
is running at startup as well. I will add all this to
/etc/rc.conf</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
ifconfig_fxp0_alias0="inet 192.168.7.60 netmask 0xffffffff"
jail_enable="YES"
jail_list="ujail"
jail_ujail_hostname="jail.mydomain.net"
jail_ujail_ip="192.168.7.60"
jail_ujail_rootdir="/usr/jail"
jail_ujail_devfs_enable="YES"
jail_ujail_devfs_ruleset="devfsrules_jail"
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Congratulations, you're done.</p>
