3.51) How do I change my hostname? 

The supported way to change your hostname is: 


# /usr/sbin/sys-unconfig

The system will halt and on subsequent boot will ask for its name and other networking parameters again. 

You may wish to save a copy of /etc/nsswitch.conf beforehand as that file is overwritten by the configuration process. 

Note that sys-unconfig is not supported on diskless or dataless workstations. On those, you'll need to edit files by hand. See the sys-unconfig(1M) for a list of the files that need changing.

the following files need to be modified
/etc/hosts
/etc/nodename
/etc/hostname.xxx (xxx is the ethernet card name)
/etc/net/ticlts/hosts
/etc/net/ticots/hosts
/etc/net/ticotsord/hosts
