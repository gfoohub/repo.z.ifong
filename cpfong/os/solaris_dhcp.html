					<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						One of the problems that can arise when trying to use a
						Solaris box as a DHCP client is that by default, the server
						is expected to supply a hostname, in addition to all the
						other stuff (like IP address, DNS servers, etc.).  Most
						cable modems and home routers don't supply a (usable)
						hostname, so it gets set to "unknown".  This page describes
						how to get around that.  (Where this page says "cable modem",
						"DSL modem" can be substituted.)
					</p>
					<p>
						This page assumes that <tt>le0</tt> is the interface you using
						for your DHCP connection.  Substitute <tt>hme0</tt> or whatever
						interface you're actually using in the examples below.
					</p>
					<h2><a name="setup"></a>Setting up DHCP</h2>
					<p>
						There are two ways of using DHCP:
						<ul>
							<li>DHCP has limited control
							<li>DHCP has full control
						</ul>
					<p>
						The first case may be where you want to use your own
						<tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> and so on, with a minimum
						of hassle.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second case would be the normal situation,
						especially if your cable modem provider has a
						habit of changing DNS name server IP addresses
						on you (like mine does!), so I'll concentrate on
						that here.  I have a <a href="dhcp_client">script</a>
						to automate the first method, should you want to
						use it.  You'll need to change the <tt>DEFAULT_ADDR</tt>
						and <tt>INTERFACE</tt> variables as required.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first thing to do is to create an empty <tt>/etc/hostname.le0</tt>,
						like this:<br>
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&gt; /etc/hostname.le0</tt><br>
						<br>
						Creating this file ensures that the interface gets plumbed,
						ready for the DHCP software to do its stuff.
					</p>
					<p>
						Next, you create <TT>/etc/dhcp.le0</TT>.  This
						file can be empty if you want to accept the defaults,
						but may also contain one or both of these directives:
						<ul>
							<li><tt>wait</tt> <i>time</i>, and
							<li><tt>primary</tt>
						</ul>
					<p>
						By default, <tt>ifconfig</tt> will wait 30 seconds
						for the DHCP server to respond (after which time,
						the boot will continue, while the interface gets
						configured in the background).  Specifying the <tt>wait</tt>
						directive tells <tt>ifconfig</tt> not to return until
						the DHCP has responded.  <i>time</i> can be set to
						the special value of <tt>forever</tt>, with obvious meaning.
						I use a <i>time</i> value of 300, which seems to be long
						enough for my cable provider.
					</p>
					<p>
						The <tt>primary</tt> directive indicates to <tt>ifconfig</tt>
						that the current interface is the primary one, if you have
						more than one interface under DHCP control.  If you only
						have one interface under DHCP control, then it is automatically
						the primary one, so <tt>primary</tt> is redundant (although
						it's permissible).
					</p>
					<p>
						With these files in place, subsequent reboots will place
						<tt>le0</tt> under DHCP control: you're ready to go!
					</p>
					<h2><a name="unknown"></a>Unknown hostname</h2>
					<p>
						Actually, there's one snag: most (if not all) cable modem
						DHCP servers don't provide you with a hostname (even if they
						did, odds are it won't be one you want anyway!).  This wouldn't
						be a problem, except that the boot scripts (<tt>/etc/init.d/rootusr</tt>
						in particular) try to be clever, and set your hostname to
						"unknown" in this case, which is not at all useful!
					</p>
					<p>
						The trick is to change your hostname back to the right one,
						preferably without changing any of the supplied start-up scripts,
						which are liable to be being stomped on when you upgrade or
						install a patch.  You've also got to do it early enough in
						the boot process, so that <tt>rpcbind</tt>, <tt>sendmail</tt>
						and friends don't get confused by using the wrong hostname.
						To solve this problem, put this <a href="set_hostname">little script</a>
						in to <tt>/etc/init.d/set_hostname</tt>, with a symbolic link
						to it from <tt>/etc/rc2.d/S70set_hostname</tt>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Starting with Solaris 10, the preceding paragraph can be ignored.
						Instead, just make sure that the hostname you want to use is in
						<tt>/etc/nodename</tt>; the contents of that file will then be
						used to set the hostname.  (Note that it is essential that the
						hostname you put into <tt>/etc/nodename</tt> is terminated with a
						carriage return.  Breakage will happen if this is not the case.)
						Also, from Solaris 8 it is possible
						to tell the DHCP software not to request a hostname from the
						DHCP server.  To do this, remove the token 12 from the
						<tt>PARAM_REQUEST_LIST</tt> line in <tt>/etc/default/dhcpagent</tt>.
						(<tt>/etc/default/dhcpagent</tt> describes what the default tokens are;
						12 is the hostname, 3 is the default router, 6 is the DNS server, and so on.)
					</p>
					<p>
						With these modifications in place, reboot, and you'll be using
						your cable modem in no time!
					</p>
					<p>
						If you've got more than one machine, and you want to access
						the Internet from all of them, you might also find my
						<a href="solaris_nat.html">Solaris NAT</A> page useful.
					</p>
