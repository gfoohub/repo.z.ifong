    <H1>Setting Up Split DNS on FreeBSD 4.1</H1>

    <TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD WIDTH="475" VALIGN="TOP">

      Our home system (cfcl) has a firewall box
      which filters packets, provides NAT,
      maps our external address to internal addresses, etc.
      Because the firewall cannot reflect local traffic
      that is addressed to cfcl's external address
      back to cfcl's internal address,
      neither cfcl nor the other local machines
      can use the "official" DNS results.
    <P>
      So, we have set up "split DNS".
      In our case, this is implemented
      as two (<TT>named(8)</TT>) DNS servers,
      serving different user communities.
      The firewall box maps external DNS requests
      to one IP address,
      the local machines use another.
      Each community gets the answers it needs,
      so there is no confusion.

    <H2>Firewall Box</H2>

      Our firewall box (a SonicWall 10)
      is not a terribly sophisticated device.
      It can filter packets, redirect IP addresses, etc.
      By and large, this is exactly what we want.
      In our opinion,
      general purpose OSes have far too much going on
      to be secure enough for use as firewalls.
      In any case, this is why we don't use the standard
      FreeBSD firewall software...
    <P>
      The SonicWall is configured
      to redirect most incoming traffic
      to cfcl's primary LAN address (<TT>...193</TT>).
      The sole exception is made for DNS requests,
      which are redirected to <TT>...199</TT>.

    <H2>/etc/rc.conf</H2>

      Because we want cfcl to listen on two IP addresses,
      we added an "alias" setting
      to the <TT>ifconfig(8)</TT> definitions
      in <TT>/etc/rc.conf</TT>.
      The first line defines our "internal" IP address.
      The second line tells cfcl to answer <TT>...199</TT>, as well.

    <PRE>
   ifconfig_de0="       inet 192.168.168.193 netmask 255.255.255.0"
   ifconfig_de0_alias0="inet 192.168.168.199 netmask 255.255.255.0"
    </PRE>


    <H2>/etc/rc.network</H2>

      Because we want two instances of <TT>named(8)</TT> to run,
      we added some code to <TT>/etc/rc.network</TT>.
      The first entry sets up our external DNS server;
      the second sets up our internal DNS server,
      using its own <TT>named.conf</TT> file.

    <PRE>
   echo -n ' named'
   ${named_program:-named} ${named_flags}

   echo -n ' named(int)'
   ${named_program:-named} ${named_flags} /etc/namedb/int/named.conf
    </PRE>

    <H2>/etc/namedb</H2>

      This directory is primarily used
      for the "external" instance of our DNS server.
      It contains:

    <PRE>
   int/                 "internal" DNS files (see below)
   localhost.rev        reverse DNS mapping information
   named.conf           top-level DNS configuration
   named.root           information about other servers
   p/                   primary DNS files
   s/                   secondary DNS files
    </PRE>

    <H2>/etc/namedb/namedb.conf</H2>

      Because cfcl now answers two IP addresses,
      we need to tell this <TT>named</TT>
      which one to answer.
      The code below tells the server
      to "listen on" the IP address (<TT>...199</TT>)
      that the SonicWall uses for our external DNS requests.


    <PRE>
   options {
     ...
     listen-on {
       192.168.168.199;      // external DNS server address
     };
   }
    </PRE>

    <H2>/etc/namedb/p</H2>

      The files in this directory
      provide forward and reverse IP mapping
      for cfcl's external address.

    <H2>/etc/namedb/s</H2>

      This directory is used
      for secondary DNS information
      and (possibly) dump files.

    <H2>/etc/namedb/int</H2>

      This directory subtree is used for the "internal" instance
      of our DNS server.
      It contains:

    <PRE>
   localhost.rev      symlink to /etc/namedb/localhost.rev
   named.conf         top-level DNS configuration
   named.root         symlink to /etc/namedb/named.root
   p/                 primary DNS files
   s/                 secondary DNS files (mostly empty)
    </PRE>

    <H2>/etc/namedb/int/named.conf</H2>

      Because this instance of the DNS server is an "add-on",
      it must make certain accomodations
      (e.g., in <TT>/var/run</TT>)
      to stay out of the way of the "standard" server.
      The <TT>listen-on</TT> code below tells this server
      to monitor both cfcl's standard IP address (<TT>...193</TT>)
      and its loopback address (<TT>127.0.0.1</TT>)
      for internal DNS requests.
      The remaining code
      tells <TT>named</TT> and <TT>ndc</TT>
      to use distinctive file names in <TT>/var/run</TT>
      for their "internal" process IDs.

    <PRE>
   options {
     ...
     listen-on {
       192.168.168.193;    // internal address for cfcl.com
       127.0.0.1;          // loopback address for cfcl.com
     };

     pid-file  "/var/run/named_int.pid";     // _PATH_PIDFILE
   };

   controls {
     unix "/var/run/ndc_int" perm 0600 owner 0 group 0;
   };
    </PRE>

    <H2>/etc/namedb/int/p</H2>

      The files in this directory
      provide forward and reverse IP mapping
      for cfcl's internal address.

    <H2>/etc/namedb/int/s</H2>

      This directory is not used
      for anything except (possibly) dump files.
