1. bsdinstall jail is good but each one need a jail dir
2. ezjail can share all but not the original
3. VIMAGE (vnet) & jail look like a good way
4. however it may cause cpu high (livejournal 2017june)
5. finally i decide to use original j ipfw/nat and buildworld myself and no vnet

Q: why jail?
A: jail each BSD at some place, and it won't affect main system

Q: why ezjail
A:
install jail is easy (bsdinstall) but manage it is another story
different jail can share same resource, however it is not that powerful like original j

Q: what is nat
A: network address translate
ip package through firewall, rewrite ip source and dest

Q: jails network ?
A: alias public nic interface, NOT using vnet (epair)
