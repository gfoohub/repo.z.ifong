6 As stated elsewhere it is probably encryption.  Here is what I have and what I did for it:
My Linux server is a test bed and thus is "officially" joined to the domain.  I
use security = server most of the time and point Samba at the NT PDC for password
resolution.  I also have encrypted password = no and update encrypted = yes so I
can collect usernames, etc.  Works great for NT but 98 has some issues with this.
Instead of letting samba create all accounts on the fly I physically created the
98 account on the Linux box with the same username and password as exists on the
NT PDC.  It now browses the shares like the NT boxes.  Once in a while Linux will
not be able to validate the 98 password and will ask the PDC which will reject it
9 out of 10 times.  Don't know why.  It also kicks the 98 boxes off the NT
network.  I go back to Linux, re input the password for the account, unlock the
account on the NT PDC and everything works again.
If you decide to set up encrypted passwords and use smbpasswd file be sure to
ENABLE the 98's account in the smbpaswd file "smbpasswd -e <username> it will ask
for a password, put in the one that exists in the both the passwd file and the NT
PDC and encryption should work with no trouble for the 98 box.

Another suggestion is go NT.  I have had zero problems with NT accessing the Linux
box and have Linux authenticate to the NT PDC.
