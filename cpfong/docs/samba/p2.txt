2. My honest suggestion would to be, as a quick fix, read the documentation
   on Encryption, as well as the Win95/NT notes, and set up the server for
   migration. Next, use the .reg files included with SAMBA for whichever
   platform you're talking about, and... TEMPORARILY... patch the client to
   use plaintext passwords. This impacts fewer users in the immediate sense,
   and allows the one problem machine to get back on the network. Go look in
   the DOCS directory under the SAMBA source tree... or, if you installed a
   RedHat Linux RPM, under /usr/doc/samba*.
