4. To make a Win98 box and a Samba talk to each other, there are 2 options:
  (1)Switch the the samba box (and all the rest of the network) to encrypted
     passwords (see ENCRYPTION.TXT).
  (2)Switch the Win98 box to plain-text passwords.
     To do so, open the Win98 explorer, doubleclick on
     Win95_PlainPassword.reg (part of the Samba distribution). The NT
     registry keys don't work for Win9x (yet).
  I recommend option (2) for now and use the "update encrypted" switch in
  smb.conf to build the password database. This should ease a later switch
  to option (1) (Szekely's box will not remain the only Win98 box at his
  LAN ;-).
