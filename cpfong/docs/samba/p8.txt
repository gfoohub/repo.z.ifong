1/14/99 - P.Sery

   I have included the Samba RPM off the Red Hat 5.2 distribution, in the
new companion CD-ROM/IDG directory, because it can handle password encryption. 
If you want to use Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 98 (or Windows 95 with password 
encryption added) then you will have to set up Samba to use encryption; the 
alternative is to set your Windows client to use plain text passwords - see 
below for more details). I have successfully tested Samba and Windows 98 
using encrypted passwords.

   Note that if you configure Samba to use encryption then your older,
non-encrypted OS's can still be authenticated because Samba will back off
and accept plain-text passwords.

   You can also enable Windows 95 to use encryption by installing the 
VRDRUPD.EXE (from www.microsoft.com) update. (I have not done this myself
but have been told by people who have that it works.

   You can turn off password encryption by modifying your registry. Please 
see the Win95_PlainPassword.reg and the NT4_PlainPassword.reg files in 
the /usr/doc/samba../docs directory for the registry necessary modifications.


Instructions for turning on Samba password encryption:

   Turn on the password encryption by editing the /etc/smb.conf file and
uncomment the following lines:

# ENCRYPTION.txt, Win95.txt and WinNT.txt in the Samba documentation.
# Do not enable this option unless you have read those documents
  encrypt passwords = yes
  smb passwd file = /etc/smbpasswd

   The Red Hat 5.2 Samba /etc/smb.conf uses the workgroup default of 
"MYGROUP" where Red Hat 5.0 defaults uses "WORKGROUP". My instructions, of 
course, use "WORKGROUP". Therefore, to use the instructions found in the book
you must change the workgroup designation on both sides of the house (Windows
and Linux) to match each other. I choose to change the /etc/smb.conf file to
to "workgroup = WORKGROUP" (case is important). You can work it the other way
if you choose but the important thing is to have them synced up.

   Next, create the smbpasswd file from you /etc/passwd file by running the 
command:

   cat /etc/passwd | mksmbpasswd.sh >/etc/smbpasswd

   Erase the lines for the root, daemon, bin users since if you leave them in 
it can create security holes; you also can eliminate all but the actual users
as well but I have to test my system first to make sure that Samba doesn't need
them to operate. Please also note that until the second half of chapter 6 I
have you use the root user to provide a simple way to get up and running fast. 
While this is okay for the initial demonstration it is not a good practice to 
continue in a production system. I make note of that in the book but want to
reiterate it here.

   Create a Samba password for each user that you want to provide with
Samba access by running the smbpasswd command as follows:

   smbpasswd iamauser

   The smbpasswd program will prompt you to enter a password twice.

   Restart the Samba daemons:

   /etc/rc.d/init.d/smb restart

   Log on to your Windows 98 box and enter a user name/password that 
corresponds to one that you have created a Samba password file for on 
the Linux/Samba server and you should see your home directory in the
Network Neighborhood.

A reader sent me the following information on turning off encryption on
Win95 and Win98 boxes:
<<<
What I did was used Regedit (a windows 95/98 program provided by Microsoft)
to adda DWORD in this registry:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\VNETSETUP
The new DWORD was named EnablePlainTextPassword and I gave it a value of one.

Like all things Linux I found this on the net on this page.
http://www.sambaix.com/sambaix/config-misc.html

It is a page for an HP-UX version of samba. It also has instructions for
modifying versions of NT.

Hope this helps,
Jim
