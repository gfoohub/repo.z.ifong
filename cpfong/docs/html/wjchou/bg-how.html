<H3>The <tt>BACKGROUND</tt> attribute</H3>
<p>
Recent versions of the proposed HTML 3.0 spec. have added a
<tt>BACKGROUND</tt> attribute to the <tt>BODY</tt> tag.  The purpose
of this attribute is to specify a URL pointing to an image which is
to be used as a background for the document.  In Netscape 1.1 this
background image is used to tile the full background of the document
viewing area.  Thus specifying:<br>
<center>
<nobr><tt>&lt;BODY BACKGROUND="textures/arena.gif"&gt;</tt><wbr>Document here</wbr><tt>&lt;/BODY&gt;</tt></nobr><br>
</center>
Would cause whatever text, images, etc. appeared in that document
to be placed on a background that would give you the look of the paper
texture from the Arena Web browser.
</p>
<H3>The <tt>BGCOLOR</tt> attribute</H3>
<p>
This attribute to <tt>BODY</tt> is not currently in the proposed HTML 3.0
spec, but we're working on it.  Basically, many people just want to change
the color of the background without having to specify a separate image that
requires another network access to load.  This attribute allows just that.
The format that Netscape 1.1 understands is:<br>
<center>
<nobr><tt>&lt;BODY BGCOLOR="#rrggbb"&gt;</tt><wbr>Document here</wbr><tt>&lt;/BODY&gt;</tt></nobr><br>
</center>
Where <tt>"#rrggbb"</tt> is a hexadecimal red-green-blue triplet used to
specify the background color.

<H1 align=center>How to control the document's foreground</H1>
<p>
Clearly, once you have control of the background, you are going to need
to also control the foreground to establish the proper contrasts.  The following
attributes are also recognized as part of the <tt>BODY</tt> tag by Netscape 1.1.
</p>
<H3>The <tt>TEXT</tt> attribute</H3>
<p>
This attribute is used to control the color of all the <i>normal</i> text
in the document.  This basically consists of all text that is not specially
colored to indicate a link.  The format of <tt>TEXT</tt> is the same as
that of <tt>BGCOLOR</tt>.<br>
<center>
<nobr><tt>&lt;BODY TEXT="#rrggbb"&gt;</tt><wbr>Document here</wbr><tt>&lt;/BODY&gt;</tt></nobr><br>
</center>
</p>
<H3>The <tt>LINK</tt>, <tt>VLINK</tt>, and <tt>ALINK</tt> attributes</H3>
<p>
These attributes let you control the coloring of link text.  <tt>VLINK</tt>
stands for visited link, and <tt>ALINK</tt> stands for active link.  The
default coloring of these is: <tt>LINK</tt>=blue, <tt>VLINK</tt>=purple, and
<tt>ALINK</tt>=red.  Again the format for these attributes is the same as that
for <tt>BGCOLOR</tt> and <tt>TEXT</tt>.<br>
<center>
<nobr><tt>&lt;BODY LINK="#rrggbb" VLINK="#rrggbb" ALINK="#rrggbb"&gt;</tt><wbr>Document here</wbr><tt>&lt;/BODY&gt;</tt></nobr><br>
</center>
</p>

<H2 align=center>Complete Example</H2>
<pre>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;Color Control Example&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY BGCOLOR="#000000" TEXT="#F0F0F0"
      LINK="#FFFF00" VLINK="#22AA22" ALINK="#0077FF"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is an example document.  Text is light-gray on black, and
&lt;a href="nowhere.html"&gt;anchors&lt;/a&gt; are yellow at first,
flashing blue-green when activated, and pale green if already visited.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;

<H2 align=center>Stuff and bother <i>(the details)</i></H2>
<p>
To state the obvious, since these color controls are all attributes of the
<tt>BODY</tt> tag, you can only set the colors <b>once</b> for the entire
document.  You cannot change coloring partially through a document.
</p>
<p>
Since setting a background image requires the fetching of an image file
from a second HTTP connection, it will <b>slow down</b> the perceived speed
of your document load.  None of your document can be displayed until the image
is loaded and decoded.  Needless to say, keep your background images small.
</p>
<p>
If you have the <b>Auto Load Images</b> option off, background images will
not be loaded.  If the background image is not loaded for any reason,
and a <tt>BGCOLOR</tt> was not also specified, then any of the foreground
controlling attributes (<tt>LINK</tt>, <tt>VLINK</tt>, and <tt>ALINK</tt>)
will be ignored.  The idea behind this is that if you didn't get your requested
background image, setting your requested text colors on top a the default
gray background may well make your document unreadable.
