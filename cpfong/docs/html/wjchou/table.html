<H1>Tables as implemented in Netscape 1.1</H1>

<H2>Netscape 1.1 tables and the proposed HTML 3.0 spec.</H2>
<p>
It has been interesting trying to faithfully reproduce tables as described
in the HTML 3.0 proposed spec. in Netscape 1.1, because as fast as I implement
something, the proposed spec. changes.  The best I can offer, is that in
order for the HTML 3.0 proposal to become a real spec. and eventual standard, 
it will some day have to stop changing.
</p>

<H2>The table tags</H2>
<dl>
<dt><font size="+1"><b>&lt;TABLE ...&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;</b></font>
<dd>This is the main wrapper for all the other table tags, and other
    table tags will be ignored if they aren't wrapped inside of a
    <tt>TABLE</tt> tag.  By default tables have no borders, borders will
    be added if the <tt>BORDER</tt> attribute is specified.
 <p>
    Right now <tt>TABLE</tt> has an implied linebreak both before and
    after it.  <i>We expect this to change</i> so that you can eventually
    have as much control over placement of tables as you currently do over
    the placement of images.  Aligning them to various positions in a line of
    text, as well as shifting them to the left or right margins and wrapping
    text around them.
 </p>

<dt><font size="+1"><b>&lt;TR ...&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;</b></font>
<dd>This stands for table row.  The number of rows in a table is exactly
    specified by how many <tt>TR</tt> tags are contained within it,
    irregardless of cells that may attempt to use the <tt>ROWSPAN</tt>
    attribute to span into non-specified rows.  <tt>TR</tt> can have
    both the <tt>ALIGN</tt> and <tt>VALIGN</tt> attributes, which if
    specified become the default alignments for all cells in this row.
<p>

<dt><font size="+1"><b>&lt;TD ...&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;</b></font>
<dd>This stands for table data, and specifies a standard table data cell.
    Table data cells must only appear within table rows.  Each row need
    not have the same number of cells specified as short rows will
    be padded with blank cells on the right.
    A cell can contain any of the HTML tags normally present in the
    body of an HTML document.  The default alignment of table data is
    <tt>ALIGN</tt>=left and <tt>VALIGN</tt>=middle.  These alignments are
    overridden by any alignments specified in the containing <tt>TR</tt> tag,
    and those alignments in turn are overridden by any <tt>ALIGN</tt> or
    <tt>VALIGN</tt> attributes explicitly specified on this cell.
    By default lines inside of table cells can be broken up to fit
    within the overall cell width.  Specifying the <tt>NOWRAP</tt>
    attribute for a <tt>TD</tt> prevents linebreaking for that cell.
 <p>

<dt><font size="+1"><b>&lt;TH ...&gt;&lt;/TH&gt;</b></font>
<dd>This stands for table header.  Header cells are identical to data
    cells in all respects, with the exception that header cells
    are in a <b>bold</b> font, and have a default <tt>ALIGN</tt>=center.
<p>

<dt><font size="+1"><b>&lt;CAPTION ...&gt;&lt;/CAPTION&gt;</b></font>
<dd>This represents the caption for a table.  <tt>CAPTION</tt> tags should
    appear inside the <tt>TABLE</tt> but not inside table rows or cells.
    The caption accepts an alignment attribute that defaults to
    <tt>ALIGN</tt>=top but can be explicitly set to <tt>ALIGN</tt>=bottom.
    Like table cells, any document body HTML can appear in a caption.
    Captions are always horizontally centered with respect to the table, and
    the may have their lines broken to fit within the width of the table.
<p>
</dl>
<hr>

<H2>The table attributes</H2>
<dl>
<dt><font size="+1"><b>BORDER</b></font>
<dd>This attribute appears in the <tt>TABLE</tt> tag.  If present, borders
    are drawn around all table cells.  If absent, there are no borders,
    but by default space is left for borders, so the same table with and
    without the <tt>BORDER</tt> attribute will have the same width.
<dt><font size="+1"><b>ALIGN</b></font>
<dd>If appearing inside a <tt>CAPTION</tt> it controls whether the caption
    appears above or below the table, and can have the values
    <b>top</b> or <b>bottom</b>, defaulting to top.
<p>
    If appearing inside a <tt>TR</tt>, <tt>TH</tt>, or <tt>TD</tt> it
    controls whether text inside the table cell(s) is aligned to the
    left side of the cell, the right side of the cell, or centered within
    the cell.  Values are <b>left</b>, <b>center</b>, and <b>right</b>.
<dt><font size="+1"><b>VALIGN</b></font>
<dd>Appearing inside a <tt>TR</tt>, <tt>TH</tt>, or <tt>TD</tt> it
    controls whether text inside the table cell(s) is aligned to the
    top of the cell, the bottom of the cell, or vertically centered within
    the cell.  It can also specify that all the cells in the row should
    be vertically aligned to the same baseline.  Values are <b>top</b>,
    <b>middle</b> <b>bottom</b>, and <b>baseline</b>.
<dt><font size="+1"><b>NOWRAP</b></font>
<dd>If this attribute appears in any table cell (<tt>TH</tt> or <tt>TD</tt>)
    it means the lines within this cell cannot be broken to fit the width
    of the cell.  Be cautious in use of this attribute as it can result
    in excessively wide cells.
<dt><font size="+1"><b>COLSPAN</b></font>
<dd>This attribute can appear in any table cell (<tt>TH</tt> or <tt>TD</tt>)
    and it specifies how many columns of the table this cell should span.
    The default <tt>COLSPAN</tt> for any cell is 1.
<dt><font size="+1"><b>ROWSPAN</b></font>
<dd>This attribute can appear in any table cell (<tt>TH</tt> or <tt>TD</tt>)
    and it specifies how many rows of the table this cell should span.
    The default <tt>ROWSPAN</tt> for any cell is 1.  A span that extends into
    rows that were never specified with a <tt>TR</tt> will be truncated.

<H2>A little more control</H2>
<p>
We found when creating tables that the creator inevitably wanted a
little more control, especially when creating complex multiply nested tables.
To this end we added a few more attributes that we are hoping to get into
The continually evolving proposed HTML 3.0 spec.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><font size="+1"><b>BORDER</b>=&lt;value&gt;</font>
<dd>By allowing the <tt>BORDER</tt> attribute to take a value, the document
    author gains two things.  First they gain the ability emphasize some
    tables with respect to others, a table with a border of four containing
    a sub-table with a border of one looks much nicer than if they both
    share the same default border width.  Second, by explicitly setting
    border to zero they regain that space originally reserved for borders
    between cells, allowing particularly compact tables.
<dt><font size="+1"><b>CELLSPACING</b>=&lt;value&gt;</font>
<dd>This is a new attribute for the <tt>TABLE</tt> tag.  By default
    Netscape 1.1 uses a cell spacing of two.  For those fussy about the look
    of their tables, this gives them a little more control.  Like it sounds, 
    cell spacing is the amount of space inserted between individual cells in
    a table.
<dt><font size="+1"><b>CELLPADDING</b>=&lt;value&gt;</font>
<dd>This is a new attribute for the <tt>TABLE</tt> tag.  By default
    Netscape 1.1 uses a cell padding of one.  Cell padding is the amount
    of space between the border of the cell and the contents of the cell.
    Setting a cell padding of zero on a table with borders might look bad
    because the edges of the text could touch the cell borders.<br>
&lt;TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0&gt;<br>
    gives the most compact table possible.
<dt><font size="+1"><b>WIDTH</b>=&lt;value_or_percent&gt;</font>
<dd>When this attribute appears on the <tt>TABLE</tt> tag it is used
    to describe the desired width of this table, either as an absolute
    width in pixels, or a percentage of document width.  Ordinarily
    complex heuristics are applied to tables and their cells to attempt
    to present a pleasing looking table.  Setting the <tt>WIDTH</tt>
    attribute overrides those heuristics and instead effort is put into
    fitting the table into the desired width as specified.  In some cases
    it might be impossible to fit all the table cells at the specified
    width, in which case Netscape 1.1 will try and get as close as possible.

<H2 align=center>Stuff and bother <i>(the details)</i></H2>
<p>
Blank cells which contain no displayable elements are not given borders.
If you wish the appearance of an empty cell, but with borders, put either
a blank line or a non-breaking space in the cell. (&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt; or &lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;)
</p>
<hr width="10%">
<p>
The proposed HTML 3.0 spec. allows you to abuse row and column spans
to create tables whose cells <b>must</b> overlap.  Don't do this, it
looks awful.
</p>
<hr width="10%">
<p>
You will eventually create a cell containing nothing but an image, and
you will wonder why your image is not properly centered inside the cell.
You probably wrote HTML like:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;td&gt;
  &lt;img src="url"&gt
&lt;/td&gt;
</pre>
<p>
That extra whitespace inside your cell and around your image gets
collapsed into single space characters.  And it is these spaces (whose
baselines by default align with the bottom of the image) which are making your
cell look lopsided.  Try this instead:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="url"&gt&lt;/td&gt;
</pre>
