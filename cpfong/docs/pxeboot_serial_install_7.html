<h2><a id="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>

<p>These are the things you are absolutely going to need &mdash; no questions asked.
If you don't have any of these, you should stop here.</p>

<ul>
<li>Above boxes' MAC address on its NIC (needed for DHCP configuration)</li>
<li>DHCP server</li>
<li>TFTP server</li>
<li>NFS server</li>
<li>FreeBSD 7.x "disc1" installation CD &mdash; either the ISO or physical CD</li>
<li>Confirmed working serial console on the box you wish to install on &mdash; make
    sure it does in fact work at speeds higher than 9600bps.  Connect it with
    a null modem cable to another machine, use <code>cu -l ttyd0 -s 115200</code>
    and make sure it works</li>
<li>A FreeBSD box where you can rebuild pieces of the base system (read: boot
    blocks) on &mdash; that means a full <code>/usr/src</code> tree</li>
<li>Ability to reboot the machine you plan on installing FreeBSD on.  This is NOT
    a requirement, but highly recommended regardless.  There are numerous places
    during the remote installation procedure where you may not end up with a
    prompt to log in, thus having remote reboot capability is needed.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">This procedure works for i386 and amd64.  There's no need to change
any of the below pathnames for amd64.  It also doesn't matter if you build
the pxeboot(8) binary on an amd64 box while the machine that plans on using it
is i386; the bootstraps are purely i386.</p>

  as a UFS disk known as /dev/md0c.  mfsroot is usually found gzip'd.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>



<h2><a id="step1">Step 1: Configuring DHCP</a></h2>

<p>I'm familiar with ISC's DHCP server, available as <code>ports/net/isc-dhcp3-server</code>.
The important pieces you need to add to your <code>/usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf</code> are here:</p>

<pre>
host newbox.home.lan {
	  hardware ethernet 00:11:22:33:44:55;
	  fixed-address newbox.home.lan;
	  next-server 192.168.1.88;
	  filename "freebsd7/boot/pxeboot";
	  option root-path "/usr/local/freebsd7";
}
</pre>

<p>Since not a single other document on the Web has described what the important
options do, I'll describe their purpose:</p>

<pre>
next-server 192.168.1.88;
</pre>

<p>This line isn't necessary if the NFS server and the DHCP server are on the
same machine.  Including it doesn't hurt.</p>

<pre>
filename "freebsd7/boot/pxeboot";
</pre>

<p>When a DHCP request is made from the Intel PXE boot ROM on the NIC, there are
additional parameters you can tell it besides just an IP number.  This argument
tells the PXE boot ROM what filename to do a TFTP request for now that it has
an IP address.  It's the first piece of code which gets run after the initial
DHCP IP negotiation is completed.</p>

<pre>
option root-path "/usr/local/freebsd7";
</pre>

<p>This is for FreeBSD.  It tells <code>pxeboot(8)</code> where the root filesystem
should be mounted from, NFS-wise.  Thus, the kernel will do the equivalent of the
following, in an attempt to get a working root filesystem, and then start
<code>init(8)</code>:</p>

<pre>
mount -t nfs 192.168.1.88:/usr/local/freebsd7 /
</pre>

<p>At this point, you should enable the ISC DHCP server in /etc/rc.conf, and
start the daemon using the appropriate rc.d script in <code>/usr/local/etc/rc.d</code>.</p>



<h2><a id="step2">Step 2: Configuring TFTP</a></h2>

<p>Uncomment the following line in <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code>, and modify it so that
the <code>-s</code> flag points to /usr/local (that's where tftpd will chroot() before
serving content):</p>

<pre>tftp    dgram   udp     wait    root    /usr/libexec/tftpd      tftpd -l -s /usr/local</pre>

<p>Add the following to <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> (assuming it's not already there):</p>

<pre>inetd_enable="yes"</pre>

<p>Now start the inetd service (thus starting tftpd):</p>

<pre>/etc/rc.d/inetd start</pre>

<p>If you already had inetd running prior to modifying <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code>, all you
need to do is send a SIGHUP to it: <code>killall -HUP inetd</code></p>



<h2><a id="step3">Step 3: Configuring NFS</a></h2>

<p>Add the following to <code>/etc/rc.conf</code>, again assuming they're not already there:</p>

<pre>
rpcbind_enable="yes"
mountd_enable="yes"
nfs_server_enable="yes"
</pre>

<p>Now we need to add an NFS export.  Edit <code>/etc/exports</code> and add the following
lines to it:</p>

<pre>/usr/local/freebsd7	-network 192.168.1 -mask 255.255.255.0</pre>

<p>This example assumes your network is 192.168.1.0/24; if it's something
else, you'll need to make appropriate changes.</p>

<p>Don't forget to make the exported directory:</p>

<pre>
mkdir /usr/local/freebsd7
chmod 755 /usr/local/freebsd7
</pre>

<p>Now start all of the above services:</p>

<pre>
/etc/rc.d/rpcbind start
/etc/rc.d/mountd start
/etc/rc.d/nfsd start
</pre>

<p>If these were running beforehand and you simply edited <code>/etc/exports</code>,
all you need to do is send a SIGHUP to <code>mountd(8)</code> to get it to re-read
the exports: <code>killall -HUP mountd</code>.</p>

<p>You should verify the NFS mount which was added is being exported:</p>

<pre>
# showmount -e
Exports list on localhost:
/usr/local/freebsd7		192.168.1.0
</pre>



<h2><a id="step4">Step 4: Copying the FreeBSD CD contents to an exported NFS mount</a></h2>

<p>We're going to need to copy all the contents off the FreeBSD 7.x "disc1" CD
to <code>/usr/local/freebsd7</code> before continuing.  We can't mount the CD
and use it directly because we're going to modify some of the contents after
the copy.  Choose one of the following:</p>

<ol class="alpha">
<li>Download a FreeBSD 7.x ISO image and untar it (see below)</li>
<li>Download a FreeBSD 7.x ISO image and mount it using <code>mdconfig(8)</code>
    and <code>mount_cd9660</code></li>
<li>Physically insert and mount the CD in the NFS server</li>
</ol>

<p>I highly recommend the first choice.  Recent FreeBSD 7.x builds (starting with
7.1-STABLE, if I remember correctly) contain an updated libarchive, which now
understands the ISO9660 format and Joliet extensions.  Simply put, this means you
can extract the contents of an .iso file without having to mount it.  Convenient,
isn't it:</p>

<pre>tar -C /usr/local/freebsd7 -pxvf 7.1-STABLE-200902-amd64-disc1.iso</pre>

<p>If this option isn't available to you, you'll have to copy the contents of the
FreeBSD ISO (or mounted CD) directly.  You can do using one of the following methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>rsync -avH /mnt/ /usr/local/freebsd7/</code> (the trailing slash is needed)</li>
<li><code>cp -pR /mnt/* /usr/local/freebsd7</code></li>
</ul>



<h2><a id="step5">Step 5: Rebuilding pxeboot(8)</a></h2>

<p>FreeBSD out-of-the-box has a hard-set serial port speed of 9600bps built in
to the boot2 bootstrap.  "So I can just pick a higher speed, right?" Nope &mdash; if
you try to do so, it'll stay at 9600bps.  If you tell boot2 to set the speed to
115200 (e.g. <code>comconsole_speed="115200"</code>), it won't work &mdash; you'll
still get 9600bps.  The best solution <b>for systems that boot off of a hard
disk</b> is to tell the boot2 bootstrap what to set the serial port speed to.
You end up putting <code>-S115200</code> in <code>/boot.config</code> and
reboot &mdash; no need to rebuild the boot blocks.  Nothing else is needed.</p>

<p>But when PXE booting, there's only one piece of the bootstrap used:
<code>pxeboot(8)</code>.  This means the only solution is to rebuild the boot
blocks with a serial port speed that has the speed you want &mdash; in this case,
115200bps.  But first, let's clear something up: <code>pxeboot(8)</code> is
actually nothing more than <code>loader(8)</code> with some extra code (see
<code>src/sys/boot/i386/pxeldr.S</code>) in it.  <code>loader(8)</code> uses a
library called libi386, which is a library used by the bootstraps only &mdash; it's
it's not something you'll find in /usr/lib or /usr/libexec.  libi386 is what
actually controls what the serial port speed is set to, thus, anything using
libi386 should have support for higher serial console speeds.  The
<code>BOOT_COMCONSOLE_SPEED</code> and <code>BOOT_COMCONSOLE_PORT</code>
variables are used in libi386.</p>

<p>Anyway, on the NFS server, do the following:</p>

<pre>
rm -fr /usr/obj/*
cd /sys/boot
make clean
make BOOT_COMCONSOLE_SPEED=115200
</pre>

<p class="note">DO NOT type "make install" after this step!  We don't want to
modify the bootstraps on the NFS server itself &mdash; we just want a
115200bps-capable pxeboot(8) binary!</p>

<p>The removal of all contents within <code>/usr/obj</code> may seem crazy, but
it's actually required for some of the below steps to work properly.  If
<code>/usr/obj</code> is populated from an old buildworld/buildkernel, "make"
will end up storing files there rather than in the current working directory.</p>

<p>There are two additional (undocumented) options which are specific to
<code>pxeboot(8)</code> and aren't part of lib386.  These are OPTIONAL; you
do not need to define or use either of them:</p>

<pre style="font-weight:bold">
BOOT_PXELDR_PROBE_KEYBOARD=1
BOOT_PXELDR_ALWAYS_SERIAL=1
</pre>

<p><code>BOOT_PXELDR_PROBE_KEYBOARD</code> is similar to the -P flag documented
in <code>boot(8)</code>.  It causes <code>pxeboot(8)</code> to look for an
attached PS/2 or AT keyboard &mdash; and if there is one, use VGA/keyboard,
otherwise assume serial console.  <code>BOOT_PXELDR_ALWAYS_SERIAL</code> tells
<code>pxeboot(8)</code> to always use the serial port, and never do anything
with a locally-attached VGA console or keyboard.</p>

<p>Now that we have a 115200bps-capable <code>pxeboot(8)</code> binary, let's
use it instead of the one originally on the CD image:</p>

<pre>
cd /sys/boot/i386/pxeldr
cp pxeboot /usr/local/freebsd7/boot
</pre>

<p>At this point, a PXE booting client should now have the capability to set the
serial port speed to 115200bps.  And don't forget to clean up the /sys/boot
directory too!  We don't want cruft laying around in there:</p>

<pre>
cd /sys/boot
make clean
</pre>



<h2><a id="step6">Step 6: Configuring loader.conf</a></h2>

<p>Now we have to update <code>/usr/local/freebsd7/boot/loader.conf</code> to
tell it to utilise serial console, and more importantly, point to where the
root filesystem (for booting) will be.  The lines <b>in bold</b> are the ones
you want to add; the others shown should already be there (don't mess with
them!):</p>

<pre>
mfsroot_load="YES"
mfsroot_type="mfs_root"
mfsroot_name="/boot/mfsroot"
<b>comconsole_speed="115200"</b>
<b>console="comconsole"</b>
<b>vfs.root.mountfrom="ufs:/dev/md0c"</b>
</pre>

<p>The serial console lines should be obvious.</p>

<p>vfs.root.mountfrom tells the kernel that after it's done booting, to try to
load the root filesystem from <code>ufs:/dev/md0c</code> before starting
<code>init(8)</code>.  Without this line, the system will attempt to mount the
root filesystem via NFS, which is not what we want.  If you want to know more
about this part of the booting procedure, you should look at the related Forth
files, as well as loader.rc in the same directory.</p>

<p>Also, some clarification (since other documentation I've read seems to
indicate that you want /dev/md0 and not /dev/md0c): /dev/md0c is what points to
the beginning of the filesystem (block 0).  The FreeBSD Handbook goes over such
filesystem lettering semantics.  So trust me, it's /dev/md0c.  :-)</p>

<p>The mfs_root loading mechanism is also programmed to support gzip decompression
automatically, so it will also look for the /boot/mfsroot.gz file &mdash; which is
what comes on the FreeBSD 7.0 "disc1" CD.  However.....</p>



<h2><a id="step7">Step 7: Workaround for a bug in mfs_root</a></h2>

<p>I've confirmed that there is in fact a bug in the mfs_root loading
mechanism.  It's likely been there for a very long time, since a couple other
guides state that after rebuilding their mfsroot, if they re-gzip'd the mfsroot
image, their machines would reboot.</p>
<p>On our servers, something bizarre happens: the kernel appears to get reloaded,
all of the environment variables are lost (which means serial console is lost),
and then there's some nastiness on the console about how it can't find
"kernel", and some weird Device ID 0xffffffff error.  I'd have to take a photo
of the monitor to provide additional details, but regardless, this problem is
easily reproducible.  I filed a PR for this problem,
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=kern/120127">kern/120127</a>,
but as of this writing not a single developer has bothered to look into it.  I'm
willing to bet this bug has bitten the EtherBoot folks as well.</p>

<p>The workaround is simple: remove the gzip compression on the mfsroot.gz image,
and everything should work:</p>

<pre>
# cd /usr/local/freebsd7/boot
# gzip -d mfsroot.gz
</pre> 



<h2><a id="step8">Step 8: Attempting your first PXE boot</a></h2>

<p>Alright, it's time to give it a try and see if it breaks!  Be patient, since
most of the TFTP loading is slow (it's UDP-based, and uses small UDP packets).
If all goes well, you should see something like this appear:</p>

<pre>
/boot/kernel/kernel text=0x71b90c data=0xadb60+0x5ac20 syms=[0x4+0x70fc0+0x4+0x90e69]

 +-----------------------------------------+
</pre>


<p>Hit Enter here, and let things boot normally.  If all goes well, you should
begin to see the acpi.ko module load, and then standard kernel output.  Near
the end, you should be shown something similar to the following:</p>

<pre>
md0: Preloaded image &lt;/boot/mfsroot&gt; 4423680 bytes at 0xc0d26ed4
Trying to mount root from ufs:/dev/md0c
/stand/sysinstall running as init on serial console

These are the predefined terminal types available to
sysinstall when running stand-alone.  Please choose the
closest match for your particular terminal.

1 ...................... Standard ANSI terminal.
2 ...................... VT100 or compatible terminal.
3 ...................... FreeBSD system console (color).
4 ...................... FreeBSD system console (monochrome).

5 ...................... xterm terminal emulator.
</pre>

<p>Pick a terminal type, and the rest should be obvious: the standard
<code>sysinstall(8)</code> selection menu, and all that jazz.</p>



<h2><a id="step9">Step 9: Choosing an installation medium</a></h2>

<p>When prompted what installation medium you want to install from, you
should pick <b>Install over NFS</b> and enter the name of the share
path manually, e.g.:</p>

<pre>192.168.1.88:/usr/local/freebsd7</pre>

<p>From there, the installation should go smoothly.  But there are some
pending things you should remember to configure after the installation
but before rebooting...</p>



<h2><a id="step10">Step 10: Important Networking options</a></h2>

<p><code>This section is under development.</code></p>
<p>
When configuring your network interface, remember to set a DNS server!
Otherwise, things like <code>sshd(8)</code> (see below) won't start.
</p>



<h2><a id="step11">Step 11: Post-installation Configuration options</a></h2>

<p><code>This section is under development.</code></p>

<p>Things I strongly recommend setting when given the chance to "set any
last configuration options" prior to the machine rebooting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Root Password</li>
<li>Time Zone</li>
<li>Networking &mdash; Enable sshd</li>
<li>User Account &mdash; </li>
<li>TTYs &mdash; Turn on <code>ttyd0</code>, with a getty type of
    <code>std.115200</code> (for 115200bps)</li>
</ul>

<p>The last item is incredibly important.  Without it, your machine will
boot as normal, but you'll never see a <code>login:</code> prompt on
the serial port.</p>
