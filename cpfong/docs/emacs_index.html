<b>Notation</b><br>
It is important to understand the notation commonly used in Emacs
documentation.  Most of the commands used in Emacs consist of a
modifier key, in conjuction with one or more other keys.  The
following are the common modifier keys:
<table border=0>
<tr><td rowspan=4 width=19></td>
    <td>CTRL</td> <td>- (C) -</td>  <td>The CONTROL key.</td></tr>
<tr><td>META</td> <td>- (M) -</td>  <td>Depending upon the terminal this is the ALT key.  You may also use the ESC key to send META.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ESC </td> <td>- (ESC) -</td><td>The ESCAPE key.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SHIFT</td><td>- (S) -</td>  <td>The SHIFT key.</td></tr>
</table>
In Emacs documentation it is common to use an abbreviated syntax when
describing key sequences.  Instead of typing
  <table border=0><tr><td width=19></td><td>CTRL-x CTRL-c</td></tr></table>
You would type
  <table border=0><tr><td width=19></td><td>C-x C-c</td></tr></table>
This would represent holding down the CONTROL key and pressing the
letter x, and then holding down the CONTROL key and pressing the
letter c.  (M-C-\ would represent holding down the the ALT key and
CONTROL key and pressing the "\" key.  You could also press and
release the ESCAPE key hold down the CONTROL key and type the "\" key.)
<br>
<br>
The following is a table of notation for other keyboard characters.
<table border=0>
<tr><td rowspan=5 width=19></td>
    <td>BACKSPC</td> <td>The BACKSPACE key.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SPC</td>     <td>The SPACE bar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ENTER</td>   <td>The Enter key.</td></tr>
<tr><td>RET</td>     <td>The Enter key.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TAB</td>     <td>The TAB key.</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<br>
<b>Insert Mode?</b><br>
This is a large place where Emacs differs from the Vi editor.  In Vi you are
either in Insert Mode or you are not.  In order to execute commands
other than key insertion you need to be out of Insertion Mode.  By
using CTRL to escape the key sequences, Emacs allows you to use the
commands at any point in your session.  For example, if you are in Vi
and are inserting text you would have to type the following key
sequence to save your file and return to Insert Mode:
  <table border=0><tr><td width=19></td><td>ESC : w i</td></tr></table>
In Emacs (which is essentially always in "Insert Mode") you would type
the following:
  <table border=0><tr><td width=19></td><td>C-x C-s  </td></tr></table>
When viewed from the insertion mode view point, Vi doesn't really save
any keystrokes over Emacs as is commonly claimed by religious Vi
advocates. (It actually requires more in most cases - the debate is
really whether you're in Insert Mode more than you are in Command Mode.)
<br>
<br>
<b>What is really happening on the backend</b><br>
Emacs is really a bunch of lisp routines programmed to operate on the
text in the buffers.  These complex routines are accessed via key
bindings on the front end.  For example, when you type an "s" you are
really telling Emacs to run the "self-insert-command" on the letter
"s" which inserts the letter "s" at the current Point of Insertion
(POI).  These backend commands can be accessed by typing M-x and then
the command.  For example, you open a file with the key binding "C-x
C-f".  You can begin the same operation by typing "M-x find-file".

  this case the file will not exist on the system until you save it
  the first time).  When you are typing the name of the file, you may
  use the tab key for filename completion.  Also you may use M-p and
