<h1>Installing FreeBSD via serial console and PXE</h1>

<h2>An author's preface...</h2>
<p>Before I get started, I want to take a moment to remind readers of an obvious
fact which, apparently, some have forgotten:</p>

<p><b>The year is 2010, not 1989.</b></p>

<p>FreeBSD was originally considered the "die-hard server operating system",
which means it was intended for servers.  It was used as such back when the
2.2.x series was available.  Datacenters today are usually massive (read: have
a very large number of servers), and require the need of 3 simple things, all
of which are well-established and common:</p>

<ol class="number">
<li>Installation of an entire OS without physical access to the box</li>
<li>Heavy reliance on the network for installation (e.g. network install)</li>
<li>Use of high speed serial console (9600+bps) from start to finish to assist
    or automate said installation.</li>
</ol>

<p>For sake of comparison, both Linux and Solaris (sparc and i386) have the above
needs addressed, but FreeBSD trails behind.  Accomplishing the above on FreeBSD
requires the knowledge which I think many administrators lack &mdash; and that's
not their fault.  Things like:</p>

<ol class="roman">
<li>Intricate knowledge of how the FreeBSD multi-stage (boot0/boot1/boot2/loader)
    bootstrap behaves, and what <code>pxeboot(8)</code> really is</li>
<li>Rebuilding above bootstraps with custom options during compile</li>
<li>Implementation of said bootstraps into PXE-based installation environments</li>
<li>Knowledge of how TFTP and DHCP work, and how to debug them if they break,</li>
<li>Familiarity with NFS (configuration and security awareness), and any one-off
    quirks that pertain to a specific FreeBSD release/version</li>
<li>Familiarity with tftpd (specifically permissions quirks it has in its code</li>
<li>Intricate knowledge of configuring a DHCP server (common question: "what's
    the 'next-server' and 'option root-path' stuff?  Is it needed?  Why?")</li>
<li>Disk label/GEOM changes (particular to 8.x)</li>
<li>Caveats/bugs with all of the above, and more.  Examples: how out-of-the-box
    FreeBSD sets the maximum serial port speed to 9600bps, not being able to do a
    complete 100% TFTP-based (e.g. no NFS) install, security issues surrounding
    use of rpcbind/mountd/nfsd (daemons binding to INADDR_ANY despite use of -h,
    using arbitrary port numbers which make it difficult to firewall off, etc.),
    undocumented <code>pxeboot(8)</code> options which are more or less
    and many other things.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you're not "acceptably" familiar with all of the above, you'll end up
smashing your head against your monitor for days before posting to a mailing
list &mdash; only to hear leaves rustle, or possibly someone saying "me too!" Most
administrators do not know how to program, and even if they did (like myself),
lack knowledge of the inner-workings of the above.  Therefore, we can't
realistically expect administrators of systems to provide patches or
enhancements to make this process easier (for sake of comparison, it took me 7
hours just to get it all up and working) &mdash; we can only expect them to report
the problems and hope someone more technical steps up to the plate.</p>

<p>With the introduction of FreeBSD 8.x into the fray, things became more
irritating.  The procedure for 8.x is more or less the same as 7.x, except there
are numerous things which will catch you off-guard.  For example, I received a
couple of reports from other administrators following my 7.x guide for 8.x, but
were running into issues.  It wasn't until I tried it myself on 8.x that I was
able to share their pain, thus working out the quirks.</p>

<p>Rant over.</p>

<p>I hope the above documents help anyone/everyone who is looking to do a
remote installation of present-day FreeBSD via PXE using serial console rather
than over VGA.</p>
