github vs netlify
--
github: spaces to save data ie hard disk
netlify: control platform

login
--
netlify use github account to login: no need to apply another netlify account
netlify logout does NOT mean logout, github has to logout first!

implement:
--
1. cust domain
2. https

link my domain with ntlify: 
 1. edit CNAME (@ my ns server): change at dns
 2. netlify domain management / Add then change at netlify 

 # note: no need for name.com since pdn.ifong.org ns is sun.ifong.org
 # however netlify name db look like also keep tracking this domain (nf.pdn.ifong.org)
