Q: i386 vs amd64
A:
 i386 refers to the 32-bit edition
 amd64 (or x86_64) refers to the 64-bit edition for Intel and AMD processors.
 Even if you have an intel CPU, you should use AMD64 to install 64-bit on your computer (it uses the same instruction sets).
 AMD invented x86-64 bit instruction set processor so the name is just a tribute to AMD.
