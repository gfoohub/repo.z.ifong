Example #1 

My name is Alice Awesome, and I'm a third-year biomedical engineering student at Michigan Tech. I just finished a six-month co-op at XYZ company, working as a quality engineer in the New Product Development Department.  I was responsible for product safety testing and assessment documentation. My engineering co-op and coursework in research methods has also prepared me to work in product development and design. I'm currently looking for a spring co-op for next year and would be thrilled to work for (your) ABC company.
