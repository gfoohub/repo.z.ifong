Example #2 My name is Mark Marvelous, and I am graduating with my bachelor’s degree in marketing in December. I’m a member of the American Marketing Association and gained hands-on experience working with the Market Research Center last summer. In 2016, I competed in a business development competition with a team of four, and my team took second place. I’m also a member of XYZ fraternity and maintain our social media pages and outreach website. In the last two years, we’ve increased our membership by 20 percent. I work well on teams, have excellent communication skills, and I’m currently looking for a full-time marketing position.
