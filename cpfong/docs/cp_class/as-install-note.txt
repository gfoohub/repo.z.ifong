-- correct install procedure will ask you to verify setting (sdk and software)

sdk manager
--
only android API 32 installed (note: higtest API level)
i install manually Lollipop Android 5.1 API 22

Device manager (for simulation)
--
API 32 need to be installed manually (not the same as SDK: using sdk manager to install sdk does NOT mean you have device manager need sdk)
i also download Lollipop API 22
