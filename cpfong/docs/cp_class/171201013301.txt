Good morning, everybody. I am very pleased to be here to introduce myself.

My name is Chih-Pin Fong and I am from Kao Shiung city of Taiwan. I graduated from university of Missouri Columbia at 1990 and major in computer engineering and get my master degree there. After my graudation, I went to silicon valley and get a job as a software engineer. After working for 3 years, I went back to my home: Taiwan and be a teacher for next 25 years.

Right now I teach at Fuzhou and I really hope to have good relationship with all my students. I like all of them and enjoy my second teaching career. Thank you for your listening.
