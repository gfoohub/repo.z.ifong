Step 1: Run the Android Studio uninstaller
Step 2: Remove the Android Studio files
 To delete any remains of Android Studio setting files, in File Explorer, go to your user folder (%USERPROFILE%), and delete .android, .AndroidStudio and any analogous directories with versions on the end, i.e. .AndroidStudio1.2, as well as .gradle and .m2 if they exist. Then go to %APPDATA% and delete the JetBrains directory. Finally, go to C:\Program Files and delete the Android directory.
Step 3: Remove SDK ( rmdir sdk /s #remove subdirectory also)
 To delete any remains of the SDK, go to %LOCALAPPDATA% and delete the Android directory. # /Users/user_or_whatever_login_name/appdata/local/sdk
Step 4: Delete Android Studio projects
 Android Studio creates projects in a folder %USERPROFILE%\AndroidStudioProjects, which you may want to delete.


1- Uninstall old Android Studio completely (from Control Panel -> Programs).
2- Delete this Android Studio folder located at C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Local\Google
3- Delete this Android Studio folder located at C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Roaming\Google
4- Delete these folders (.android ,.AndroidStudio*, .gradle) located at C:\Users\<user_name>
