       -bp  -  This  option tells suck to build a batch file, and
       post the articles  in  that  batchfile  to  the  localhost
       (specified  with  the  -hl  option).  This option uses the
       IHAVE command to post all downloaded articles to the local
       host.   The  batch file is called suck.post, and is put in
       the temporary directory (-dt).  It is deleted upon comple­
       tion,  as  are  the  successfully posted articles.  If the
       article is not wanted by the server  (usually  because  it
       already exists on the server, or it is too old), the arti­
       cle is also deleted.  If other errors occur,  the  article
       is  NOT deleted.  With the following command line, you can
       download and post articles without  worrying  if  you  are
       using INND or CNEWS.
