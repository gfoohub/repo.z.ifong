NAME
       expireover   -  Expire  entries	from  the  news  overview
       database

SYNOPSIS
       expireover [ -e ] [ -f file ] [ -k ] [ -N ] [ -p ] [ -q	]
       [ -s ] [ -w number ] [ -z rmfile ] [ -Z lofile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Expireover   expires   entries	from  the  news  overview
       database.   It  reads  a  list	of   newsgroup	 list	(
       <pathdb in inn.conf>/active).   (A  file name of ``-'' may
       be used to specify the standard input.)	It  then  removes
       any   mention  of  those  articles  from  the  appropriate
       overview database.  If ``groupbaseexpiry'' in inn.conf  is
       ``true'',  expireover  also  expires  articles.	 If  it's
       ``false'', ``-e'', ``-k'', ``-N'', ``-p'', ``-q'',  ``-w''
       and ``-z'' flags are ignored.

OPTIONS
       -e     If  the  ``-e''  flag  is used, then as soon as the
	      first cross posting of  the  article  expires,  all
	      overview	 entries  relevant  to	the  article  are
	      removed.	Note that you cannot use both ``-e''  and
	      ``-k'' flag at the same time.

       -f     When  the ``-f'' flag is used, then expireover will
	      use it as newsgroup  list  instead  of  <pathdb  in
	      inn.conf>/active file.  A name of ``-'' is taken to
	      mean the standard input.

       -k     When the ``-k'' flag is  used,  then  articles  are
	      removed  when  they  have been expired from all the
	      groups they appear in.  Note that  you  cannot  use
	      both ``-e'' and ``-k'' flag at the same time.

       -N     If  the  storing method has self expire functional-
	      ity, then the control  file  is  ignored	for  that
	      article  by  default.   If the ``-N'' flag is used,
	      expireover purges  articles  and	overview  entries
	      with the control file.

       -p     Expireover  makes  its  decisions  on  the time the
	      article arrived by default.   This  means  articles
	      are  often  kept	a  little  longer than with other
	      expiration programs that base  their  decisions  on
	      the  article's  posting date.  To use the article's
	      posting date, use the ``-p'' flag.

       -q     Expireover normally prints statistics at the end of
	      process.	 To  suppress this action, use the ``-q''
	      flag.

       -s     Expireover normally checks the existense	of  arti-
	      cles  only  if  ``EXPENSIVESTAT''  of  its  storage
	      method is set to ``FALSE''.  To do stat  all  arti-
	      cles   regardless  of  ``EXPENSIVESTAT'',  use  the
	      ``-s'' flag.  See storage.conf(5) for ``EXPENSIVES-
	      TAT''.

       -w     Use  the	``-w''	flag  to  ``warp''  time  so that
	      expireover thinks it is running at some time  other
	      then  the  current  time.   The  value  should be a
	      signed floating point number of the number of  days
	      to use as the offset.

       -z     If  the  ``-z'' flag is used, then articles are not
	      removed, but their toknes are appended to the spec-
	      ified  file.   See  the  description  of delayrm in
	      news.daily(8).

       -Z     If the ``-Z'' flag is used, then the lowest article
	      numbers for each newsgroup after expiry are written
	      to the specified lofile with newsgroup name.   This
	      flag  can  be  used  when  doing	``ctlinnd  lomark
	      lofile''.
