NAME
       expire.ctl - control file for Usenet article expiration

DESCRIPTION
       The  file  <pathetc in inn.conf>/expire.ctl is the default
       control file for the expire(8) or  expireover(8)  program,
       which  read  it	at  start-up.  It serves two purposes: it
       defines how long history entries for expired  or  rejected
       articles are retained, and it determines how long articles
       not stored in a self-expiring storage method are retained.
       If all of the storage methods used by the server are self-
       expiring (such as CNFS), only the  ``/remember/''  setting
       described below is necessary or used.

       Blank lines and lines beginning with a number sign (``#'')
       are ignored.  All other lines should be in one of two for-
       mats.

       The  first  format  specifies  how  long  to  keep history
       entries for articles  that  aren't  present  in	the  news
       spool.	These  are  articles  which  have  either already
       expired out of spool or which  the  server  rejected  (and
       ``remembertrash''  was set to true in inn.conf(5)).  There
       should only be one line in this format, which looks like:
	      /remember/:days
       where days is a floating-point number that  specifies  the
       minimum number of days a history record of a given message
       ID is retained, regardless  of  whether	the  article  has
       expired.   (History  entries  are always retained at least
       until an article fully expires.)

       The reason to retain a record of an  old  articles  is  to
       handle the case where a peer offers old articles that were
       previously accepted and then expired.  Without  a  setting
       like  this,  the server would accept the article again and
       readers would see duplicate articles.  Articles older than
       a  certain  number of days won't be accepted by the server
       at all (see the ``-c'' flag of innd(8)), and this  setting
       should  probably  match	that  time  period  (14  days  by
       default) to ensure the server never accepts duplicates.

       This setting does not affect article expirations.

       Most of the lines in this file will be in the second  for-
       mat,  either  four  or five colon-separated fields as fol-
       lows:
	      classnum:keep:default:purge
       or
	      pattern:modflag:keep:default:purge
       The former is used for  class  based  expiry  which  means
       ``groupbaseexpiry''  in	inn.conf(5) is ``false'', and the
       latter is used for group based expiry which means ``group-
       baseexpiry''  in  inn.conf  is ``true''.  Both formats can
       not coexist each other.

       Where classnum field used for class based  expiry  is  the
       number that you specified in storage.conf(5).

       The pattern field used for group based expiry is a list of
       wildmat(3)-style  patterns,  separated  by  commas.   This
       field  specifies  the  newsgroups  to  which  the  line is
       applied.  Note that the file is interpreted in  order  and
       the  last  line that matches will be used, so general pat-
       terns (like a single asterisk to set the defaults)  should
       appear  at the beginning of the file, before more specific
       settings.

       The modflag field used for group based expiry can be  used
       to further limit newsgroups to which the line applies, and
       should be chosen from the following set:
	      M    Only moderated groups
	      U    Only unmoderated groups
	      A    All groups
	      X    Removes the article from all groups that it appears in
       (The X flag is special; normally  articles  are	not  com-
       pletely	deleted until they expire out of every group they
       were posted to, but if an article is  expired  by  a  line
       with  an  X,  it  is  deleted out of all newsgroups it was
       posted to immediately.)

       The rest of three fields are used to determine how long an
       article	should	be  kept.   Each field should be either a
       number of days (fractions like ``8.5'' are allowed) or the
       word  ``never.''   The  most  common use is to specify the
       default value for how long an article should be kept.  The
       first  and  third  fields -- keep and purge -- specify the
       boundaries within which an Expires header will be honored.
       They are ignored if an article has no Expires header.  (In
       other words, if	an  article  does  not	have  an  Expires
       header,	only default field is used and the Date header is
       be honored to expire.  But if an article  has  an  Expires
       header,	default  is not used, and articles are expired no
       faster than the time set with keep and kept no longer than
       the  time specified with purge regardless of Expires head-
       ers).  One should think of  the	fields	as  ``lower-bound
       default upper-bound.''  Since most articles do not have an
       Expires header, the second field  tends	to  be	the  most
       important and most commonly applied one.

       The  keep  field specifies how many days an article should
       be kept before it will be  removed.   No  article  in  the
       matching  newsgroups  or  class	will be removed if it has
       been received for  less	than  keep  days,  regardless  of
       Expires	header.   If this field is the word ``never,'' no
       article in the matching newsgroups or class will  ever  be
       expired.

       The default field specifies how long to keep an article if
       no Expires header is present.  If this field is	the  word
       ``never''  then articles without explicit expiration dates
       will never be expired.

       The purge field specifies the upper bound on how  long  an
       article	can be kept.  No article will be kept longer then
       the number of days specified by this field.  All  articles
       will  be removed after then have been kept for purge days.
       If purge is the word ``never'' then the article will never
       be deleted.

       If the line for classnum is not defined, keep, default and
       purge are assumed to be all ``0''.  (See below for default
       definition.)

       It  is  often  useful to honor the Expires header in arti-
       cles, especially those in moderated groups.  To	do  this,
       set  keep to zero, default to whatever value you wish, and
       purge to never (or alternately set  purge  to  some  large
       number,	like  365  days  for  a maximum article life of a
       year).  To ignore any Expires header, set all three fields
       to the same value.

       For  group  based  expiry,  there must be exactly one line
       with a pattern of ``*'' and a modflags of  ``A''  --  this
       matches	all  groups  and  is  used  to set the expiration
       default.  And for class base expiry, there can be  exactly
       one line with a class of ``255'' -- this matches all class
       and can be used to set the expiration default.  In  either
       case, it should be the first expiration line.

EXAMPLES
       For class based expiry;
	    ##	How long to keep expired history
	    /remember/:5
	    ##	class 0 stay for two weeks
	    0:14:14:14
       For group based expiry;
	    ##	How long to keep expired history
	    /remember/:5
	    ##	Most things stay for two weeks
	    *:A:14:14:14
	    ##	Believe expiration dates in moderated groups,
	    ##	up to six weeks
	    *:M:1:30:42
	    ##	Keep local stuff for a long time
	    foo.*:A:30:30:30
