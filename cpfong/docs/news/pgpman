1. PGP OPTIONS
       Note

       pgp <ASCII-armored_message>
	      Instructs  PGP to decrypt an ASCII-armored message.

       pgp <ciphertext_filename> [-o plaintext_filename]
	      Instructs  PGP  to decrypt an encrypted file, or to
	      check the signature integrity of a signed file.


       pgp <keyring_filename>
	      Instructs PGP to display all the keys in a specific
	      key  ring  filename. When you use this command, PGP
	      lists  all  the  keys  in  keyfile.pgp,  and   also
	      attempts	to  add them to your key ring if they are
	      not already on your key ring.


       pgp -c <plaintext filename>
	      Instructs PGP to encrypt a plaintext file with con-
	      ventional cryptography only.


       pgp -e <plaintext_filename> <recipients_userid>
	      Instructs  PGP to encrypt a plaintext file with the
	      recipient's public key.


       pgp    -e    <textfile-filename>    <userid1>	<userid2>
       <userid3>...
	      Instructs PGP to encrypt a message for  any  number

       pgp -esa <message.txt> <recipients_userid>
	      Instructs  PGP  to  produce  a  ciphertext  file in
	      ASCII-armored format. The  generated  file  can  be

       pgp -feast <recipients_userid> <inputfile >outputfile
