<H2><A NAME="s7">7. The mailing list remailer</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Subscribing</A>
</H2>

<P>The method of subscribing to each e-mail list is different, although
most involve sending some kind of e-mail message.  Please be very careful
not to send to the replicating address of the mailgroup.  This is a
sure way to annoy the members of the list.  Most remailers (but not
all) have a separate address for subscribing.  In confctrl, the 
administration address is confctrl-request@isi.edu as 
explained by http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/mmusic-charter.html.
<P>
<P>When you successfully subscribe you should (hopefully) see 
a welcome message in the newsgroup.
<P>
<P>Some mailing lists do not let you subscribe an address you are
not mailing from.  In this case you will need to forge the return
address of an e-mail.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Forging mail</A>
</H2>

<P>Forgeing mail is easiest to do with an old Netscape client.  It
would accept anything for a return address.  Fortunately, modern
browsers require you to retreive mail successfully for an address
before they will let you send.  Thus, you are required to fall back
the tried and true method....telnet.
<P>
<H3>Looking up MX hosts</H3>

<P>When you speficy a web page, your browser does a DNS lookup
to convert the domain name into an IP address.  This is a lookup
of an "A" record.  (Also "CNAME" records are considered.)  When
sending mail a "MX" record is looked up.  If this is missing a
"CNAME" or "A" one is used.  Thus, to forge mail you need to do
an MX lookup.

thus you would use tnt.isi.edu.  (If you don't have dig,
<CODE>nslookup</CODE> will do.)
<P>
<H3>SMTP</H3>

<P>Mail is delivered using the Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP).
Like most good Internet protocols, it is ASCII based to make troubleshooting
and development easier.  I will not explain everything, but simply give
an example.  Hopefully, this is enough.
<P>
<P>The protocol is line oriented.  Each email as specified in RFC822, is
composed of headers and body which are separated by the first blank line
(no characters, not even spaces).  SMTP specifies the end of an e-mail 
with a line containing only a period.

<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Be patient</A>

<P>The mailing list is last because in part it is the slowest.
When you mail to the reflected address, it may take up to an hour
to see the response.
