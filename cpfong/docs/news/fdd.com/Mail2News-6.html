<H2><A NAME="s6">6. The local mailer daemon</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Overview</A>
</H2>

<P>We need to create a local e-mail address for the remailer to mail to.
This address will be configured to 
run a program (to post the newsgroup) every time an e-mail arrives.  
Unfortunately, (for us)
this feature (called "pipe to program") is not usually enabled
for security reasons.
<P>
<P>This HOWTO only describes modifying sendmail.  <CODE>qmail</CODE> is
another excellent option, but not yet covered here. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Creating a mail alias</A>
</H2>

<P>Instead of creating a new user account, we will only create an alias.
For sendmail these are kept in <CODE>/etc/aliases</CODE>.  The
syntax is defined in the man page...
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
man aliases
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>In our example the username of the mail address is
<CODE>confctrl</CODE> which posts to the local newsgroup 
<CODE>ietf.confctrl</CODE>, so we add a line like ...
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
confctrl:   |" /usr/local/bin/mail2news.pl ietf.confctrl "
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>The double quotes are required.
There cannot be a space between the
first double quotes and the | (pipe) character, or
sendmail will complain  "User unknown".  Huh?
<P>
<P>Whenever you modify the <CODE>/etc/aliases</CODE> file you need to
notify sendmail.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
sendmail -bi
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Did it work?</A>
</H2>

<P>After you send an e-mail, check the /var/log/maillog to 
see if it worked.  The log may contain a useful error
message.  I found it convenient to open up another terminal 
window to follow the log with
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
tail -f /var/log/maillog
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Enabling "pipe to program"</A>
</H2>

<P>"Pipe to program" is the CGI of mail.  When an e-mail
arrives, instead of appending
to a file, sendmail runs a program (or script) and feeds the mail 
to its standard input.
<P>
<P>Actually, with RedHat-6.0 sendmail comes with "pipe to program" enabled,
but essentially only a limited number of programs are runnable.  User 
security was not an issue on my machine, so I found it easiest
to enable running of everything. 
Besides, there was no man
page for smrsh.
<P>
<P>To liberalize "pipe to program" we 
need to modify <CODE>sendmail.cf</CODE> (by modifying <CODE> sendmail.mc</CODE>) so that the restricted shell is not used.  
Strangely, uncommenting the smrsh feature didn't
work, I needed to change the shell from <CODE>/usr/sbin/smrsh</CODE>
to <CODE>/bin/bash</CODE>.  
Without this change I kept getting a <CODE>"Service unavailable"</CODE> error
message in the <CODE>/var/log/maillog</CODE> file.
<P>
<P>The header of <CODE>/etc/senmail.mc</CODE> of RedHat-6 has a bug.  The proper
command line is...
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
m4 /etc/sendmail.mc >/etc/sendmail.cf
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You need to do this when you change <CODE>sendmail.mc</CODE>.  Hopefully,
RedHat will extend the super cool Makefile idea in <CODE>/etc/mail</CODE>
so you only have to type <CODE>make</CODE>.
You will need to install <CODE>sendmail-cf.</CODE>something<CODE>.rpm</CODE> first.
e.g. ...
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
rpm -i sendmail-cf-8.9.3-10.i386.rpm
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Whenever you modify the sendmail.cf file, you should restart sendmail...
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail restart
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>From: Jeppe Sorensen of maxiom.se ...<BR>
One can solve the security issue by simply putting the
<CODE>mail2news.pl</CODE> script in the <CODE>/etc/smrsh</CODE> 
directory and chown and chmod the file accordingly.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 Documentation</A>
</H2>

<P>With RedHat, sendmail documentation does not install by default.  
I comes in a separate RPM with a name like sendmail-doc-8.9.3-10.i386.rpm.
This will create <CODE>/usr/doc/sendmail</CODE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
rpm -i sendmail-doc-*
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>http://www.sendmail.org/&nbsp;ca/email/doc/op-sh-5.html
describes the syntax of sendmail.cf. I hope you don't have
to use it.
<P>
<P>This is a description of the features you are modifying in sendmail.mc
http://www.sendmail.org/m4/features.html
<P>
<P>Sendmail has a man page...
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
man sendmail
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6 Unprivledged</A>
</H2>

<P>If you are having trouble, and create an e-mail alias with a
different (simpler) target script to test it, remember that sendmail
runs the program as an unprivledged user, who probably doesn't
have privledges to write anywhere except globally writable directories
such as <CODE>/tmp</CODE>.
