I maintain a local mailing list for the graduate student house here at
Harvard. We also have a usenet newsgroup setup in our local
hierarchy. What I do now is everytime I approve a submission for the
mailing list I also post it to the newsgroup by copy-paste into my
newsreader. What I would like to do is have everything that is sent to
the mailing list automagically posted to the newsgroup. I'm running
the mailing list using MajorDomo 1.92 on a SparcStation1+ running
4.1.3. I have access to an nntp host at the university. Is there
anyway to do what I want?

------------------------------------------------------------------
   I'm looking to do that very thing quite soon. 

   I was thinking of a low-tech solution:
   - add a user or alias to the mailing list
   - have that user or alias forward to a program that kicks off the
      inews(?) netnews posting program.
