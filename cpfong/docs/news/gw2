We receive a few mailing lists here and would like to make them available (at
least readable, postable if possible) to the users here as newsgroups.  Is
there a way to automatically gateway entries received from a mailing list
directly into a newsgroup?  I know I can extract the mail and post in news, but
that would be painful.  Since it appears some sites do gateway between mailing
lists and newsgroups (info-vax, for one) it must not be too hard.  The part I
don't understand is how you do it automatically.

The way I handle this it to create a newsgroup with the /MAILLIST
qualifier. This makes the group moderated, with the mailing list being
the moderator. That way articles that are posted locally are mailed
directly to the mailing list.

Next, I subscribe NEWSMGR to the mailing list.  My periodic batch
program extracts the mail to a file which is later added to the NEWS
database via ADD FILE/DEFNEWSGROUP. I use unique personal names for
each mailing list, so the To: address is different for each list. That
way I can use the MAIL command SELECT/TO=whatever followed by EXTRACT
to get the mail for a specific list.  Because of the way MAIL works,
this means that I can't have things in the MAIL folder.  I have a
program that massages the mail before it is added, but it is mostly
cosmetic. I can send you a copy if you want one.  If you are dealing
with BITNET LISTSERV type mailing lists, it is helpful to set your
subscription to FULLHDR.  Just send the command SET mailing FULLHDR to
LISTSERV@site from the account that is subscribed.

Fair enough - this seems a good way of going about it: we don't have that
situation here.  However, how do you avoid messages `looping'?

Whereas, we subscribe some random name to the mailing list, and forward
its mail to PMDF DELIVER%NEWSMGR, which has a command file that
understands the various random names and applies the appropriate
/DEFNEWSGROUP.  The advantage of this is that the incoming mailing list
mail gets posted as soon as it arrives.  The disadvantage is that the
command file is not a little hairy, and has to be edited for every new
mailing list we think of.

If you fancy my horrible command file, drop me a line.  (I think I've
been -ve enough there to discourage a flood of requests ;-) (please)

There can't be any "looping" problem. When the user posts an article,
it is emailed to the mailing list, it IS NOT posted locally. It will
get added to the local database when it comes back from the mailing
list via the NEWSMGR subscription.

I considered this, but I have had DELIVER abort on me frequently. For
example if the To: address is longer than 256 (512?) characters, which
can happen easily when there are multiple To: addresses in the header,
the batch job dies horribly trying to assign a string that is too long.

We have a simpler although perhaps less elegant solution.

For each mailing list, I create an account and subscribe it to the list in
question. I find this is the easiest way to deal with listservers, rather than
creating an alias and then having trouble convincing the listserver to remove
you from the list at some later date.

In the account, I put a command file which checks & extracts all incoming mail
and adds it to the required group. Each account has newsmanager privs. The
news_post.cc file holds the mailing address of the group for outgoing postings.

The command file is submitted every time a News update is done (every 30
minutes). I enclose a copy below - fairly straightforward really. This is the
one I use for the info-multinet mailing list.

I just subscribe the NEWSMGR account and use a different personal name
for each mailing list. I usually send something like:

SUB list-l KU_list-l Gateway

Then when I want to extract the artilce from mail, I can do:

MAIL> SEL/TO=KU_list-l NEWMAIL
MAIL> EXTRACT/ALL/APPEND list-l.MAIL

Let me see if I understand.  The entry in NEWS_POST.CC sends a copy of
the locally posted article to the mailing list, right? The article
gets posted locally, and also gets emailed to the mailing list.  What
happens when that article comes back to the account subscribed to the
list? Doesn't it get added again?  How do you avoid duplicates?

I was going to keep quiet since I we're down to just one list that we post
locally, but maybe this will be useful to others.  Before we had a news feed, I
used to just subscribe to a whole bunch of both Bitnet and Internet lists and
post them to local newsgroups.  I can't remember exactly why, but I originally
had problems using the To: address on some lists.  There were other ways to
select these lists, but I came to the conclusion that the only method of
sorting the mail that would work for ANY list was to use separate accounts for
each one and I prefered having them all the same to trying to figure out what
method would work on which lists and setting them all up differently.

I agree, /MAILLIST works better than the NEWS_POST.CC for this.

The thing I did differently was that I created each account with a different
username, but I used the NEWSMGR UIC for all of them and gave them each a
subdirectory in the NEWSMGR directory with the same name as the newsgroup.
This makes it pretty easy to manage and lets me post mail from all the lists
from the NEWSMGR account with one job, it works for any type of list, and they
are all set up exactly the same way.  There is a periodic NEWSMGR job with one
line for each list like:

   Read the rest of this message... (38 more lines)

and we have an even simpler way to do it... everything as above (including
a hearty YES! to the listserv comment) except that we SET FORWARD=NEWSMGR
in the account created and then delete the account. due to a 'feature' of
VMS MAIL, mail sent to that userid will still be accepted and forwarded
to NEWSMGR, where we have a very similar comfile (except that ours
SELECT/To=<account_name> and then EXTRACT/ALL <list-name> and then
ADD FILE <list-name>. works pretty good. :)

-cgw-

ps: you might think the listserv problem still exists with this solution:
not so. the latest version of JNET lets you do this:
SEND/USER=<list-name> LISTSERV@node SIGNOFF <list-name>
the /USER qualifier is a wonderful timesaver!

I must say that this has worked very well at our site!  It is much easier to
handle.  However, I don't have each of the usernames running a job that puts
its own mail into news.  I have a job run by newsmgr that does it for all of
these accounts. (the news manager has privs to read the mail files)  I even
put POSTMASTER's mail into a restricted newsgroup.

eg.

    $   set noon
    $   write sys$output "Extracting mailed items"
    $   mail
    set file user$disk:[usunovell.mail]
    set folder newmail
    extract/all novell.mail
    delete/all
    set file user$disk:[usugis.mail]
    set folder newmail
    extract/all gis.mail
    delete/all
    set file disk$util:[usupmdf.mail]
    set folder newmail
    extract/all pmdf.mail
    delete/all
    set file disk$util:[usumulti.mail]
    set folder newmail
    extract/all multi.mail
    delete/all
    set file disk$util:[usucmu.mail]
    set folder newmail
    extract/all cmu.mail
    delete/all
    set file JAN_ROOT:[POSTMASTER]
    set folder newmail
    extract/all postmaster.mail
    delete/all
    exit
    $ ! and so on...
