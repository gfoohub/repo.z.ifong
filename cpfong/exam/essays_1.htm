<center><h2>How to Write Essay Exams</h2></center>

As you consider each question, remember that your goal is not to exhaust your
knowledge on the subject (spill your guts) but rather to select the proper
facts to answer it, arranging them in a coherent essay.  I grade mostly on
factual content, but I also give some consideration to organization and
mechanics.  Besides, if your answer is disorganized and ungrammatical, then
you will not communicate your content to me effectively.<p>

The essay requirements on exams for this course are modest, but important.  Each exam will 
include a question or selection of questions to which you are to respond with a short essay--just 
a paragraph--counting 10 points.

<h3>Steps in Writing the Essay</h3>

To construct the best possible answer, I suggest you follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Read the question and be sure you know just what it asks.<p>
<li>Assemble the pertinent facts in rough notes.<p>
<li>Write a good topic sentence that answers the question in a nutshell
and indicates the direction your essay is going to take.<p>
<li>Arrange the supporting facts in good order, the sentences in your paragraph developing 
and supporting your topic sentence.<p>
<li>Read the essay over to see that it makes sense and to make revisions in
style.
</ol>

<h3>More Advice About Essays</h3>

Remember most of all that to score well, you must take a position (in your topic sentence) 
in response to the question and support your position with facts. 
Come to the exam armed with a supply of facts and an understanding of
concepts.<p>

One more admonition.  Show respect for my advancing age by writing your essay legibly
with a blue or black pen, not a pencil.<p>

Coming attraction!  Students last semester told me it would be a good idea to provide a sample essay, showing how to develop a topic sentence in the manner I'm looking for.  I'll do that before the first exam and link it from this page.<p>
