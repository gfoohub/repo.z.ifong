TC version 4.5 Control Panel Terminal Server work OK!

1. you have to know your environment and put Real IP
ex: at home my ip is 192.168.1.12 --> then dhcp start ip 192.168.1.30 --> 192.168.1.60
dns use 8.8.8.8 gateway use 192.168.1.1 (do NOT use the default one!!)

2. if you are at public ip environment ex 163.15.202.xx, you have to use 
163.15.202.30 --> 163.15.202.60  (TC role will be another DHCPD, that is, 
your TC box won't  be router or gateway or what ever)

3. dhcpd timeout is ok, don't be panic

4. some NIC is not working, for example, my home DELL desktop not work, but 
irene toshiba notebook work great
