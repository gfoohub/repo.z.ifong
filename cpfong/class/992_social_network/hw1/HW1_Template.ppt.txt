Sensor networks may contain up to thousands of sensor nodes. The major applications include environmental monitoring and surveillance [1][2] in either home, office or open spaces. Various types of measurement data can be collected in a sensor network, such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and noise levels. Therefore a sensor network can be considered as a virtual database [1] containing a large volume of data. Then, corresponding technical challenges including efficient query processing [3] and pattern discovery are generally addressed.

感測器網路可能包含數以千計的感測器節點，主要應用在於家庭、公司與開放空間的環境監控或保全監視等用途。感測器網路中可收集到許多不同型態的量測資料，諸如：溫度、壓力、濕度與噪音程度等，因此，感測器網路亦可視為一個包含大量資料的虛擬資料庫，於是相關的技術挑戰 (包含有效率地進行查詢處理或發掘未知的樣式) 將會被廣泛地注意到

段落中有參考到的文句
Technological advances in recent years have enabled the deployment of large-scale sensor networks consisting of hundreds or thousands of inexpensive sensors in an ad-hoc fashion [1].

Such networks now are used for a variety of environmental monitoring and surveillance purposes including measurements of meteorological data (e.g. temperature, pressure, humidity), noise levels, chemicals, etc [1].

A large volume of sensing data generated by sensors is needed to be processed within the network to respond to queries from users. The wireless sensor network is thus treated as a virtual database by the database community [1].

A number of sensor network systems have been deployed for monitoring a person’s whereabouts at varying levels of granularity ranging from home level monitoring to worldwide GPS monitoring [2].

To process a query, the query has to be sent to every sensor in the entire network, and the cost soon increases with network size [3].
