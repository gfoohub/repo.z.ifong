    Poster Guidelines


      Poster size:

The size of the board space for each poster is 45" x 45". It is better
to make your poster not exceed these dimensions.

Alternatively, you can make your poster in A0 size (33.1" x 46.8"), but
it must be in the *portrait* orientation. In this size your poster will
extend beyond the bottom edge of the board by 1.8" inches, which is ok.


      Mounting method:

The poster boards are velcro receptive and push pin receptive. The
mounting materials will be provided.


      Poster set-up time:

For the CIKM'10 main conference, posters will be displayed during lunch
and reception on October 27 in the Imperial Room. The poster boards will
be set up during 10:00am - 12:00 noon. The poster authors should mount
their posters at 12:00 noon. Lunch will be provided in the room.

For workshops, the set-up time depends on the workshop schedule. Boards
will be set up in your workshop room right before the scheduled poster
session.


      Poster tear-down time:

For the main conference, please take down your posters at 9:00 pm on
October 27.
