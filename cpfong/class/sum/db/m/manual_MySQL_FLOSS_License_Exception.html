Version 0.2, July 2004

</P>
<P>
The MySQL AB Exception for Free/Libre and Open Source Software-only
Applications Using MySQL Client Libraries (the ``FLOSS Exception'').

</P>

<H2>24.9  Exception Intent</H2>

<P>
We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software (``FLOSS'') applications
to be able to use specified GPL-licensed MySQL client libraries (the
``Program'') despite the fact that not all FLOSS licenses are compatible with
version 2 of the GNU General Public License (the ``GPL''). 

</P>

<H2>24.10  Legal Terms and Conditions</H2>

<P>
As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0 of the
GPL:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely from
the Program and one or more works (each, a ``FLOSS Work'') licensed under
one or more of the licenses listed below in section 1, as long as:


<OL>
<LI>

You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the Derivative
Work, except for identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which
are not derived from the Program, and which can reasonably be
considered independent and separate works in themselves, 

<LI>

all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not
derived from the Program, and which can reasonably be considered
independent and separate works in themselves,

<DL COMPACT>

<DT>i
<DD>
are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and
<DT>ii
<DD>
the object code or executable form of those sections are
accompanied by the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code for those sections on the same medium and under the
same FLOSS license as the corresponding object code or
executable forms of those sections, and
</DL>

<LI>

any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a Derivative
Work on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in accordance
with the GPL, can reasonably be considered independent and separate
works in themselves which are not derivatives of either the Program,
a Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.
</OL>

If the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only be copied,
modified, distributed or used under the terms and conditions of the GPL or
another valid licensing option from MySQL AB.

Due to the many variants of some of the above licenses, we require that any
version follow the 2003 version of the Free Software Foundation's Free
Software Definition (<a HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>) or version

<LI>Definitions


<OL>
<LI>

Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided in
the GPL.
<LI>

Derivative Work means a derivative work under copyright law.
</OL>

<LI>Applicability

This FLOSS Exception applies to all Programs that contain a notice placed by
MySQL AB saying that the Program may be distributed under the terms of this
FLOSS Exception.  If you create or distribute a work which is a Derivative
Work of both the Program and any other work licensed under the GPL, then
this FLOSS Exception is not available for that work; thus, you must remove
the FLOSS Exception notice from that work and comply with the GPL in all
respects, including by retaining all GPL notices.  You may choose to
redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under the terms of the GPL by
removing the FLOSS Exception notice from that copy of the Program, provided
that the copy has never been modified by you or any third party.
