<P>
This section summarizes the features that we plan to implement in
MySQL Server. The items are ordered by release series. Within a list,
items are shown in approximately the order they will be done.

</P>
<P>
<strong>Note</strong>: If you are an enterprise-level user with an urgent need
for a particular feature, please contact <a HREF="mailto:sales@mysql.com">sales@mysql.com</a> to
discuss sponsoring options. Targeted financing by sponsor companies
allows us to allocate additional resources for specific purposes.
One example of a feature sponsored in the past is replication.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="TODO_MySQL_5.0" HREF="manual_toc.html#TODO_MySQL_5.0">C.1  New Features Planned for 5.0</A></H2>

<P>
The following features are planned for inclusion into MySQL 5.0.
Some of the features such as stored procedures are complete and are
included in MySQL 5.0 alpha, which is available now.  Others such
as cursors are only partially available. Expect these and other
features to mature and be fully supported in upcoming releases.

</P>
<P>
Note that because we have many developers that are working on different
projects, there will also be many additional features. There is also a
small chance that some of these features will be added to MySQL 4.1.
For a list what is already done in MySQL 4.1, see section <A HREF="manual_Introduction.html#Nutshell_4.1_features">1.3.2.1  Features Available in MySQL 4.1</A>.

</P>
<P>
For those wishing to take a look at the bleeding edge of MySQL
development, we make our BitKeeper repository for
MySQL version 5.0 publicly available.
See section <A HREF="manual_Installing.html#Installing_source_tree">2.8.3  Installing from the Development Source Tree</A>.
As of December 2003, binary builds of version 5.0 are also available.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Views
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Views, implemented in stepwise fashion up to full functionality.
See section <A HREF="manual_Introduction.html#ANSI_diff_Views">1.5.5.6  Views</A>. See section <A HREF="manual_SQL_Syntax.html#CREATE_VIEW">13.2.7  <code>CREATE VIEW</code> Syntax</A>.
</UL>

<DT>Stored Procedures
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Stored procedures currently are implemented, based on the SQL:2003
standard.
See section <A HREF="manual_Stored_Procedures.html#Stored_Procedures">19  Stored Procedures and Functions</A>.

</UL>

<DT>New functionality
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Elementary cursor support.
See section <A HREF="manual_Stored_Procedures.html#Cursors">19.1.8  Cursors</A>.
<LI>

The ability to specify explicitly for <code>MyISAM</code> tables that an index
should be created as an <code>RTREE</code> index.  (In MySQL 4.1, <code>RTREE</code> indexes
are used internally for geometrical data that use GIS data types, but cannot be
created on request.)
<LI>

Dynamic length rows for <code>MEMORY</code> tables.
</UL>

<DT>Standards compliance, portability and migration
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Support for Data Dictionary / <code>INFORMATION_SCHEMA</code>.
<LI>

Add true <code>VARCHAR</code> support (column lengths longer than 255, and
no stripping of trailing whitespace).
There is already support for this in the <code>MyISAM</code> storage engine,
but it is not yet available at the user level.
</UL>

<DT>Speed enhancements
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

<code>SHOW COLUMNS FROM <var>tbl_name</var></code> (used by the <code>mysql</code> client to allow
expansions of column names) should not open the table, only the
definition file. This will require less memory and be much faster.
<LI>

Allow <code>DELETE</code> on <code>MyISAM</code> tables to use the record cache.
To do this, we need to update the threads record cache when we update
the <tt>`.MYD'</tt> file.
<LI>

Better support for <code>MEMORY</code> tables:

<UL>
<LI>

Dynamic length rows.
<LI>

Faster row handling (less copying).
</UL>

</UL>

<DT>Usability enhancements
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Resolving the issue of <code>RENAME TABLE</code> on a table used in an active
<code>MERGE</code> table possibly corrupting the table.
</UL>

</DL>

<P>
The news section of this manual includes a more in-depth list of features.
See section <A HREF="manual_News.html#News-5.0.x">D.1  Changes in release 5.0.x (Development)</A>.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="TODO_MySQL_5.1" HREF="manual_toc.html#TODO_MySQL_5.1">C.2  New Features Planned for 5.1</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT>New functionality
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

<code>FOREIGN KEY</code> support for all table types, not just <code>InnoDB</code>.
<LI>

Column-level constraints.
See section <A HREF="manual_Introduction.html#Constraints">1.5.6  How MySQL Deals with Constraints</A>.
<LI>

Online backup with very low performance penalty.  The online backup will
make it easy to add a new replication slave without taking down the
master.
</UL>

<DT>Speed enhancements
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

New text based table definition file format (<tt>`.frm'</tt> files) and a
table cache for table definitions.  This will enable us to do faster
queries of table structures and do more efficient foreign key support.
<LI>

Optimize the <code>BIT</code> type to take one bit. (<code>BIT</code> now takes one byte;
it is treated as a synonym for <code>TINYINT</code>.)
</UL>

<DT>Usability enhancements
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Add options to the client/server protocol to get progress notes
for long running commands.
<LI>

Implement <code>RENAME DATABASE</code>. To make this safe for all storage engines,
it should work as follows:

<OL>
<LI>

Create the new database.
<LI>

For every table, do a rename of the table to another database, as
we do with the <code>RENAME</code> command.
<LI>

Drop the old database.
</OL>

<LI>

New internal file interface change.  This will make all file handling much
more general and make it easier to add extensions like RAID.
</UL>

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="TODO_future" HREF="manual_toc.html#TODO_future">C.3  New Features Planned for the Near Future</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT>New functionality
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Oracle-like <code>CONNECT BY PRIOR</code> to search tree-like (hierarchical)
structures.
<LI>

Add all missing standard SQL and ODBC 3.0 types.
<LI>

Add <code>SUM(DISTINCT)</code>.
<LI>

<code>INSERT SQL_CONCURRENT</code> and <code>mysqld --concurrent-insert</code> to do
a concurrent insert at the end of a table if the table is read-locked.
<LI>

Allow variables to be updated in <code>UPDATE</code> statements. For example:
<code>UPDATE foo SET @a:=a+b,a=@a, b=@a+c</code>.
<LI>

Change when user variables are updated so that you can use them with
<code>GROUP BY</code>, as in the following statement:
<code>SELECT id, @a:=COUNT(*), SUM(<var>sum_col</var>)/@a FROM <var>tbl_name</var> GROUP BY id</code>.
<LI>

Add an <code>IMAGE</code> option to <code>LOAD DATA INFILE</code> to not update
<code>TIMESTAMP</code> and <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> columns.
<LI>

Add <code>LOAD DATA INFILE ... UPDATE</code> syntax that works like this:

<UL>
<LI>

For tables with primary keys, if an input record contains a primary key
value, existing rows matching that primary key value are updated from the
remainder of the input columns. However, columns corresponding to columns
that are <em>missing</em> from the input record are not touched.
<LI>

For tables with primary keys, if an input record does not contain the primary
key value or is missing some part of the key, the record is treated as
<code>LOAD DATA INFILE ... REPLACE INTO</code>.
</UL>

<LI>

Make <code>LOAD DATA INFILE</code> understand syntax like this:

<PRE>
LOAD DATA INFILE '<var>file_name</var>.txt' INTO TABLE <var>tbl_name</var>
     TEXT_FIELDS (text_col1, text_col2, text_col3)
     SET table_col1=CONCAT(text_col1, text_col2),
         table_col3=23
     IGNORE text_col3
</PRE>

This can be used to skip over extra columns in the text file,
or update columns based on expressions of the read data.
<LI>

New functions for working with <code>SET</code> type columns:

<UL>
<LI><code>ADD_TO_SET(<var>value</var>,<var>set</var>)</code>

<LI><code>REMOVE_FROM_SET(<var>value</var>,<var>set</var>)</code>

</UL>

<LI>

If you abort <code>mysql</code> in the middle of a query, you should open
another connection and kill the old running query.
Alternatively, an attempt should be made to detect this in the server.
<LI>

Add a storage engine interface for table information so that you can use it as a system
table. This would be a bit slow if you requested information about all tables,
but very flexible.  <code>SHOW INFO FROM <var>tbl_name</var></code> for basic table information
should be implemented.
<LI>

Allow <code>SELECT a FROM <var>tbl_name1</var> LEFT JOIN <var>tbl_name2</var> USING (a)</code>; in this
case <code>a</code> is assumed to come from <var>tbl_name1</var>.
<LI>

<code>DELETE</code> and <code>REPLACE</code> options to the <code>UPDATE</code> statement
(this will delete rows when a duplicate-key error occurs while updating).
<LI>

Change the format of <code>DATETIME</code> to store fractions of seconds.
<LI>

Make it possible to use the new GNU <code>regexp</code> library instead of the current
one (the new library should be much faster than the current one).
</UL>

<DT>Standards compliance, portability and migration
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Add <code>ANY()</code>, <code>EVERY()</code>, and <code>SOME()</code> group functions. In
standard SQL, these work only on boolean columns, but we can extend these to
work on any columns or expressions by treating a value of zero as FALSE and
non-zero values as TRUE.
<LI>

Fix the type of <code>MAX(column)</code> to be the same as the column type:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE t1 (a DATE);
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (NOW());
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE t2 SELECT MAX(a) FROM t1;
mysql&#62; SHOW COLUMNS FROM t2;
</PRE>

</UL>

<DT>Speed enhancements
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Don't allow more than a defined number of threads to run <code>MyISAM</code>
recovery at the same time.
<LI>

Change <code>INSERT INTO ... SELECT</code> to optionally use concurrent inserts.
<LI>

Add an option to periodically flush key pages for tables with delayed
keys if they haven't been used in a while.
<LI>

Allow join on key parts (optimization issue).
<LI>

Add a log file analyzer that can extract information about which tables
are hit most often, how often multiple-table joins are executed, and so on. This
should help users identify areas of table design that could be optimized
to execute much more efficient queries.
</UL>

<DT>Usability enhancements
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Return the original column types when doing
<code>SELECT MIN(column) ... GROUP BY</code>.
<LI>

Make it possible to specify <code>long_query_time</code> with a granularity
in microseconds.
<LI>

Link the <code>myisampack</code> code into the server so that it can perform
<code>PACK</code> or <code>COMPRESS</code> operations.
<LI>

Add a temporary key buffer cache during <code>INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE</code> so that we
can gracefully recover if the index file gets full.
<LI>

If you perform an <code>ALTER TABLE</code> on a table that is symlinked to another
disk, create temporary tables on that disk.
<LI>

Implement a <code>DATE/DATETIME</code> type that handles time zone information
properly, to make dealing with dates in different time zones easier.
<LI>

Fix <code>configure</code> so that all libraries (like <code>MyISAM</code>)
can be compiled without threads.
<LI>

Allow user variables as <code>LIMIT</code> arguments; for example,
<code>LIMIT @a,@b</code>.
<LI>

Automatic output from <code>mysql</code> to a Web browser.
<LI>

<code>LOCK DATABASES</code> (with various options).
<LI>

Many more variables for <code>SHOW STATUS</code>.  Record reads and
updates.  Selects on a single table and selects with joins.  Mean number of
tables in selects. Number of <code>ORDER BY</code> and <code>GROUP BY</code> queries.
<LI>

<code>mysqladmin copy database new-database</code>; this requires a <code>COPY</code>
operation to be added to <code>mysqld</code>.
<LI>

Processlist output should indicate the number of queries/threads.
<LI>

<code>SHOW HOSTS</code> for printing information about the hostname cache.
<LI>

Change table names from empty strings to <code>NULL</code> for calculated columns.
<LI>

Don't use <code>Item_copy_string</code> on numerical values to avoid
number-to-string-to-number conversion in case of
<code>SELECT COUNT(*)*(id+0) FROM <var>tbl_name</var> GROUP BY id</code>.
<LI>

Change so that <code>ALTER TABLE</code> doesn't abort clients
that execute <code>INSERT DELAYED</code>.
<LI>

Fix so that when columns are referenced in an <code>UPDATE</code> clause,
they contain the old values from before the update started.
</UL>

<DT>New operating systems
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Port the MySQL clients to LynxOS.
</UL>

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="TODO_sometime" HREF="manual_toc.html#TODO_sometime">C.4  New Features Planned for the Mid-Term Future</A></H2>


<UL>
<LI>

Implement function: <code>get_changed_tables(timeout,table1,table2,...)</code>.
<LI>

Change reading through tables to use <code>mmap()</code> when possible. Now only
compressed tables use <code>mmap()</code>.
<LI>

Make the automatic timestamp code nicer.  Add timestamps to the update
log with <code>SET TIMESTAMP=val;</code>.
<LI>

Use read/write mutex in some places to get more speed.
<LI>

Automatically close some tables if a table, temporary table, or temporary file
gets error 23 (too many open files).
<LI>

Better constant propagation. When an occurrence of <var>col_name=n</var>
is found in an expression, for some constant <code>n</code>, replace other
occurrences of <var>col_name</var> within the expression with <code>n</code>.
Currently, this is done only for some simple cases.
<LI>

Change all const expressions with calculated expressions if possible.
<LI>

Optimize <var>key</var> = <var>expr</var> comparisons. At the moment, only
<var>key</var> = <var>column</var> or <var>key</var> = <var>constant</var> comparisons are
optimized.
<LI>

Join some of the copy functions for nicer code.
<LI>

Change <tt>`sql_yacc.yy'</tt> to an inline parser to reduce its size and get
better error messages.
<LI>

Change the parser to use only one rule per different number of arguments
in function.
<LI>

Use of full calculation names in the order part (for Access97).
<LI>

<code>MINUS</code>, <code>INTERSECT</code>, and <code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code>.
(Currently <code>UNION</code> and <code>LEFT|RIGHT OUTER JOIN</code> are supported.)
<LI>

Allow <code>SQL_OPTION MAX_SELECT_TIME=val</code>, for placing a time limit on a query.
<LI>

Allow updates to be logged to a database.
<LI>

Enhance <code>LIMIT</code> to allow retrieval of data from the end of a result set.
<LI>

Alarm around client connect/read/write functions.
<LI>

Please note the changes to <code>mysqld_safe</code>: According to FSSTND (which
Debian tries to follow), PID files should go into <tt>`/var/run/&#60;progname&#62;.pid'</tt>
and log files into <tt>`/var/log'</tt>. It would be nice if you could put the
"DATADIR" in the first declaration of "pidfile" and "log" so that the
placement of these files can be changed with a single statement.
<LI>

Allow a client to request logging.
<LI>

Allow the <code>LOAD DATA INFILE</code> statement
to read files that have been compressed with <code>gzip</code>.
<LI>

Fix sorting and grouping of <code>BLOB</code> columns (partly solved now).
<LI>

Change to use semaphores when counting threads.  One should first implement
a semaphore library for MIT-pthreads.
<LI>

Add full support for <code>JOIN</code> with parentheses.
<LI>

As an alternative to the one-thread-per-connection model, manage a pool
of threads to handle queries.
<LI>

Allow <code>GET_LOCK()</code> to obtain more than one lock.  When doing this, it is
also necessary to handle the possible deadlocks this change will introduce.
</UL>
