This appendix will help you port MySQL to other operating systems.
Do check the list of currently supported operating systems first.
See section <A HREF="manual_Installing.html#Which_OS">2.1.1  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL</A>.
If you have created a new port of MySQL, please let us know so that
we can list it here and on our Web site (<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>),
recommending it to other users.

</P>
<P>
Note: If you create a new port of MySQL, you are free to copy and
distribute it under the GPL license, but it does not make you a
copyright holder of MySQL.

</P>
<P>
A working POSIX thread library is needed for the server. On Solaris 2.5
we use Sun PThreads (the native thread support in 2.4 and earlier
versions is not good enough), on Linux we use LinuxThreads by Xavier
Leroy, <a HREF="mailto:Xavier.Leroy@inria.fr">Xavier.Leroy@inria.fr</a>.

</P>
<P>
The hard part of porting to a new Unix variant without good native
thread support is probably to port MIT-pthreads. See
<tt>`mit-pthreads/README'</tt> and Programming POSIX Threads
(<a HREF="http://www.humanfactor.com/pthreads/">http://www.humanfactor.com/pthreads/</a>).

</P>
<P>
Up to MySQL 4.0.2, the MySQL distribution included a patched version of
Chris Provenzano's Pthreads from MIT (see the MIT Pthreads Web page at
<a HREF="http://www.mit.edu/afs/sipb/project/pthreads/">http://www.mit.edu/afs/sipb/project/pthreads/</a> and a programming
introduction at <a HREF="http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/proven/IAP_2000/">http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/proven/IAP_2000/</a>).
These can be used for some operating systems that do not have POSIX threads.
See section <A HREF="manual_Installing.html#MIT-pthreads">2.8.5  MIT-pthreads Notes</A>.

</P>
<P>
It is also possible to use another user level thread package named
FSU Pthreads (see <a HREF="http://moss.csc.ncsu.edu/~mueller/pthreads/">http://moss.csc.ncsu.edu/~mueller/pthreads/</a>).
This implementation is being used for the SCO port.

</P>
<P>
See the <tt>`thr_lock.c'</tt> and <tt>`thr_alarm.c'</tt> programs in the <tt>`mysys'</tt>
directory for some tests/examples of these problems.

</P>
<P>
Both the server and the client need a working C++ compiler. We use <code>gcc</code>
on many platforms. Other compilers that are known to work are SPARCworks,
Sun Forte, Irix <code>cc</code>, HP-UX <code>aCC</code>, IBM AIX <code>xlC_r</code>), Intel
<code>ecc/icc</code> and Compaq <code>cxx</code>).

</P>
<P>
To compile only the client use <code>./configure --without-server</code>.

</P>
<P>
There is currently no support for only compiling the server, nor is it
likly to be added unless someone has a good reason for it.

</P>
<P>
If you want/need to change any <tt>`Makefile'</tt> or the configure script you
will also need GNU Automake and Autoconf.
See section <A HREF="manual_Installing.html#Installing_source_tree">2.8.3  Installing from the Development Source Tree</A>.

<P>
If you run into problems with a new port, you may have to do some debugging
of MySQL!
See section <A HREF="manual_Porting.html#Debugging_server">E.1  Debugging a MySQL Server</A>.

</P>
<P>
<strong>Note</strong>: Before you start debugging <code>mysqld</code>, first get the test
programs <code>mysys/thr_alarm</code> and <code>mysys/thr_lock</code> to work.  This
will ensure that your thread installation has even a remote chance to work!

</P>

If you are using some functionality that is very new in MySQL,
you can try to run <code>mysqld</code> with the <code>--skip-new</code> (which will disable all
new, potentially unsafe functionality) or with <code>--safe-mode</code> which
disables a lot of optimization that may cause problems.
See section <A HREF="manual_Problems.html#Crashing">A.4.2  What to Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

</P>
<P>
If <code>mysqld</code> doesn't want to start, you should verify that you don't have
any <tt>`my.cnf'</tt> files that interfere with your setup!
You can check your <tt>`my.cnf'</tt> arguments with <code>mysqld --print-defaults</code>
and avoid using them by starting with <code>mysqld --no-defaults ...</code>.

</P>
<P>
If <code>mysqld</code> starts to eat up CPU or memory or if it ``hangs,'' you
can use <code>mysqladmin processlist status</code> to find out if someone is
executing a query that takes a long time.  It may be a good idea to
run <code>mysqladmin -i10 processlist status</code> in some window if you are
experiencing performance problems or problems when new clients can't connect.

</P>
<P>
The command <code>mysqladmin debug</code> will dump some information about
locks in use, used memory and query usage to the MySQL log file. This
may help solve some problems.  This command also provides some useful
information even if you haven't compiled MySQL for debugging!

</P>
<P>
If the problem is that some tables are getting slower and slower you
should try to optimize the table with <code>OPTIMIZE TABLE</code> or
<code>myisamchk</code>.  See section <A HREF="manual_MySQL_Database_Administration.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">5  Database Administration</A>. You should also
check the slow queries with <code>EXPLAIN</code>.

</P>
<P>
You should also read the OS-specific section in this manual for
problems that may be unique to your environment.
See section <A HREF="manual_Installing.html#Operating_System_Specific_Notes">2.12  Operating System-Specific Notes</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Compiling_for_debugging" HREF="manual_toc.html#Compiling_for_debugging">E.1.1  Compiling MySQL for Debugging</A></H3>

<P>
If you have some very specific problem, you can always try to debug
MySQL.  To do this you must configure MySQL with the
<code>--with-debug</code> or the <code>--with-debug=full</code> option.  You can check
whether MySQL was compiled with debugging by doing:
<code>mysqld --help</code>.  If the <code>--debug</code> flag is listed with the
options then you have debugging enabled.  <code>mysqladmin ver</code> also
lists the <code>mysqld</code> version as <code>mysql ... --debug</code> in this case.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <code>gcc</code> or <code>egcs</code>, the recommended <code>configure</code> line is:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O2" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O2 -felide-constructors \
   -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
   --with-debug --with-extra-charsets=complex
</PRE>

<P>
This will avoid problems with the <code>libstdc++</code> library and with C++
exceptions (many compilers have problems with C++ exceptions in threaded
code) and compile a MySQL version with support for all character sets.

</P>
<P>
If you suspect a memory overrun error, you can configure MySQL
with <code>--with-debug=full</code>, which will install a memory allocation
(<code>SAFEMALLOC</code>) checker. However, running with <code>SAFEMALLOC</code> is
quite slow, so if you get performance problems you should start
<code>mysqld</code> with the <code>--skip-safemalloc</code> option. This will
disable the memory overrun checks for each call to <code>malloc()</code> and
<code>free()</code>.

</P>
<P>
If <code>mysqld</code> stops crashing when you compile it with
<code>--with-debug</code>, you probably have found a compiler bug or a timing
bug within MySQL.  In this case, you can try to add <code>-g</code> to
the <code>CFLAGS</code> and <code>CXXFLAGS</code> variables above and not use
<code>--with-debug</code>. If <code>mysqld</code> now dies, you can at least attach
to it with <code>gdb</code> or use <code>gdb</code> on the core file to find out
what happened.

</P>
<P>
When you configure MySQL for debugging you automatically enable a
lot of extra safety check functions that monitor the health of <code>mysqld</code>.
If they find something ``unexpected,'' an entry will be written to
<code>stderr</code>, which <code>safe_mysqld</code> directs to the error log!  This also
means that if you are having some unexpected problems with MySQL and
are using a source distribution, the first thing you should do is to
configure MySQL for debugging!  (The second thing is to
send mail to a MySQL mailing list and ask for help.
See section <A HREF="manual_Introduction.html#Mailing-list">1.4.1.1  The MySQL Mailing Lists</A>.
Please use the
<code>mysqlbug</code> script for all bug reports or questions regarding the
MySQL version you are using!

</P>
<P>
In the Windows MySQL distribution, <code>mysqld.exe</code> is by
default compiled with support for trace files.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Making_trace_files" HREF="manual_toc.html#Making_trace_files">E.1.2  Creating Trace Files</A></H3>

<P>
If the <code>mysqld</code> server doesn't start or if you can cause it
to crash quickly, you can try to create a trace file to find the problem.

</P>
<P>
To do this, you must have a <code>mysqld</code> that has been compiled with
debugging support.
You can check this by executing <code>mysqld -V</code>.  If the version number
ends with <code>-debug</code>, it's compiled with support for trace files.

</P>
<P>
Start the <code>mysqld</code> server with a trace log in <tt>`/tmp/mysqld.trace'</tt>
on Unix or <tt>`C:\mysqld.trace'</tt> on Windows:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld --debug
</PRE>

<P>
On Windows, you should also use the <code>--standalone</code> flag to not start
<code>mysqld</code> as a service.  In a console window, use this command:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; mysqld --debug --standalone
</PRE>

<P>
After this, you can use the <code>mysql.exe</code> command-line tool in a
second console window to reproduce the problem. You can stop the
<code>mysqld</code> server with <code>mysqladmin shutdown</code>.

</P>
<P>
Note that the trace file will become <strong>very big</strong>!
If you want to generate a smaller trace file, you can use debugging options
something like this:

</P>
<P>
<code>mysqld --debug=d,info,error,query,general,where:O,/tmp/mysqld.trace</code>

</P>
<P>
This only prints information with the most interesting tags to the trace file.

</P>
<P>
If you make a bug report about this, please only send the lines from the
trace file to the appropriate mailing list where something seems to go
wrong! If you can't locate the wrong place, you can ftp the trace file,
together with a full bug report, to
<a HREF="ftp://ftp.mysql.com/pub/mysql/upload/">ftp://ftp.mysql.com/pub/mysql/upload/</a> so that a MySQL
developer can take a look a this.

</P>
<P>
The trace file is made with the <strong>DBUG</strong> package by Fred Fish.
See section <A HREF="manual_Porting.html#The_DBUG_package">E.3  The DBUG Package</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Using_gdb_on_mysqld" HREF="manual_toc.html#Using_gdb_on_mysqld">E.1.3  Debugging <code>mysqld</code> under <code>gdb</code></A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2396"></A>

</P>
<P>
On most systems you can also start <code>mysqld</code> from <code>gdb</code> to get
more information if <code>mysqld</code> crashes.

</P>
<P>
With some older <code>gdb</code> versions on Linux you must use <code>run
--one-thread</code> if you want to be able to debug <code>mysqld</code> threads.  In
this case, you can only have one thread active at a time.  We recommend you
to upgrade to gdb 5.1 ASAP as thread debugging works much better with this
version!

</P>
<P>
NTPL threads (the new thread library on Linux) may cause problems while
running <code>mysqld</code> under <code>gdb</code>. Some symptoms are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<code>mysqld</code> hangs during startup (before it writes
 <code>ready for connections</code>).
<LI>

<code>mysqld</code> crashes during a
<code>pthread_mutex_lock()</code> or <code>pthread_mutex_unlock()</code> call.
</UL>

<P>
In this case you should set the following environment variable
in the shell before starting <code>gdb</code>:

</P>

<PRE>
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1
export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL
</PRE>

<P>
When running <code>mysqld</code> under <code>gdb</code>, you should disable
the stack trace with <code>--skip-stack-trace</code> to be able to catch
segfaults within <code>gdb</code>.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL 4.0.14 and above you should use the <code>--gdb</code> option to
mysqld.  This will install an interrupt handler for <code>SIGINT</code> (needed
to stop <code>mysqld</code> with <code>^C</code> to set breakpoints) and disable stack
tracing and core file handling.

</P>
<P>
It's very hard to debug MySQL under <code>gdb</code> if you do a lot of
new connections the whole time as <code>gdb</code> doesn't free the memory for
old threads.  You can avoid this problem by starting <code>mysqld</code> with
<code>-O thread_cache_size= 'max_connections +1'</code>.  In most cases just
using <code>-O thread_cache_size=5'</code> will help a lot!

</P>
<P>
If you want to get a core dump on Linux if <code>mysqld</code> dies with a
SIGSEGV signal, you can start <code>mysqld</code> with the <code>--core-file</code> option.
This core file can be used to make a backtrace that may help you
find out why <code>mysqld</code> died:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; gdb mysqld core
gdb&#62;   backtrace full
gdb&#62;   exit
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="manual_Problems.html#Crashing">A.4.2  What to Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <code>gdb</code> 4.17.x or above on Linux, you should install a
<tt>`.gdb'</tt> file, with the following information, in your current
directory:

</P>

<PRE>
set print sevenbit off
handle SIGUSR1 nostop noprint
handle SIGUSR2 nostop noprint
handle SIGWAITING nostop noprint
handle SIGLWP nostop noprint
handle SIGPIPE nostop
handle SIGALRM nostop
handle SIGHUP nostop
handle SIGTERM nostop noprint
</PRE>

<P>
If you have problems debugging threads with <code>gdb</code>, you should download
gdb 5.x and try this instead. The new <code>gdb</code> version has very improved
thread handling!

</P>
<P>
Here is an example how to debug mysqld:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; gdb /usr/local/libexec/mysqld
gdb&#62; run
...
backtrace full # Do this when mysqld crashes
</PRE>

<P>
Include the above output in a mail generated with <code>mysqlbug</code> and
mail this to the general MySQL mailing list.
See section <A HREF="manual_Introduction.html#Mailing-list">1.4.1.1  The MySQL Mailing Lists</A>.

</P>
<P>
If <code>mysqld</code> hangs you can try to use some system tools like
<code>strace</code> or <code>/usr/proc/bin/pstack</code> to examine where
<code>mysqld</code> has hung.

</P>

<PRE>
strace /tmp/log libexec/mysqld
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2397"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2398"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2399"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2400"></A>
If you are using the Perl <code>DBI</code> interface, you can turn on
debugging information by using the <code>trace</code> method or by
setting the <code>DBI_TRACE</code> environment variable.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Using_stack_trace" HREF="manual_toc.html#Using_stack_trace">E.1.4  Using a Stack Trace</A></H3>

<P>
On some operating systems, the error log will contain a stack trace if
<code>mysqld</code> dies unexpectedly. You can use this to find out where (and
maybe why) <code>mysqld</code> died. See section <A HREF="manual_MySQL_Database_Administration.html#Error_log">5.9.1  The Error Log</A>.  To get a stack trace,
you must not compile <code>mysqld</code> with the <code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code>
option to gcc. See section <A HREF="manual_Porting.html#Compiling_for_debugging">E.1.1  Compiling MySQL for Debugging</A>.

</P>
<P>
If the error file contains something like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
mysqld got signal 11;
The manual section 'Debugging a MySQL server' tells you how to use a
stack trace and/or the core file to produce a readable backtrace that may
help in finding out why mysqld died
Attempting backtrace. You can use the following information to find out
where mysqld died.  If you see no messages after this, something went
terribly wrong...
stack range sanity check, ok, backtrace follows
0x40077552
0x81281a0
0x8128f47
0x8127be0
0x8127995
0x8104947
0x80ff28f
0x810131b
0x80ee4bc
0x80c3c91
0x80c6b43
0x80c1fd9
0x80c1686
</PRE>

<P>
you can find where <code>mysqld</code> died by doing the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Copy the preceding numbers to a file, for example <tt>`mysqld.stack'</tt>.

<LI>

Make a symbol file for the <code>mysqld</code> server:

<PRE>
nm -n libexec/mysqld &#62; /tmp/mysqld.sym
</PRE>

Note that most MySQL binary distributions (except for the "debug" packages,
where this information is included inside of the binaries themselves)
already ship with the above file, named <code>mysqld.sym.gz</code>.
In this case, you can simply unpack it by doing:


<PRE>
gunzip &#60; bin/mysqld.sym.gz &#62; /tmp/mysqld.sym
</PRE>

<LI>

Execute <code>resolve_stack_dump -s /tmp/mysqld.sym -n mysqld.stack</code>.

This will print out where <code>mysqld</code> died. If this doesn't help you
find out why <code>mysqld</code> died, you should make a bug report and include
the output from the above command with the bug report.

Note however that in most cases it will not help us to just have a stack
trace to find the reason for the problem.  To be able to locate the bug
or provide a workaround, we would in most cases need to know the query
that killed <code>mysqld</code> and preferable a test case so that we can
repeat the problem!  See section <A HREF="manual_Introduction.html#Bug_reports">1.4.1.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.
</OL>



<H3><A NAME="Using_log_files" HREF="manual_toc.html#Using_log_files">E.1.5  Using Log Files to Find Cause of Errors in <code>mysqld</code></A></H3>

<P>
Note that before starting <code>mysqld</code> with <code>--log</code> you should
check all your tables with <code>myisamchk</code>.
See section <A HREF="manual_MySQL_Database_Administration.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">5  Database Administration</A>.

</P>
<P>
If <code>mysqld</code> dies or hangs, you should start <code>mysqld</code> with
<code>--log</code>.  When <code>mysqld</code> dies again, you can examine the end of
the log file for the query that killed <code>mysqld</code>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <code>--log</code> without a file name, the log is stored in
the database directory as <tt>`<var>host_name</var>.log'</tt> In most cases it is the last
query in the log file that killed <code>mysqld</code>, but if possible you
should verify this by restarting <code>mysqld</code> and executing the found
query from the <code>mysql</code> command-line tools. If this works, you
should also test all complicated queries that didn't complete.

</P>
<P>
You can also try the command <code>EXPLAIN</code> on all <code>SELECT</code>
statements that takes a long time to ensure that <code>mysqld</code> is using
indexes properly. See section <A HREF="manual_MySQL_Optimization.html#EXPLAIN">7.2.1  <code>EXPLAIN</code> Syntax (Get Information About a <code>SELECT</code>)</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can find the queries that take a long time to execute by starting
<code>mysqld</code> with <code>--log-slow-queries</code>. See section <A HREF="manual_MySQL_Database_Administration.html#Slow_query_log">5.9.5  The Slow Query Log</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you find the text <code>mysqld restarted</code> in the error log file
(normally named <tt>`hostname.err'</tt>) you probably have found a query
that causes <code>mysqld</code> to fail.  If this happens, you should check all
your tables with <code>myisamchk</code> (see section <A HREF="manual_MySQL_Database_Administration.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">5  Database Administration</A>),
and test the queries in the MySQL log files to see if one doesn't
work.  If you find such a query, try first upgrading to the newest
MySQL version.  If this doesn't help and you can't find anything
in the <code>mysql</code> mail archive, you should report the bug to a MySQL
mailing list.
The mailing lists are described at
<a HREF="http://lists.mysql.com/">http://lists.mysql.com/</a>, which also has links to online
list archives.

</P>
<P>
If you have started <code>mysqld</code> with <code>myisam-recover</code>,
MySQL will automatically check and try to repair <code>MyISAM</code>
tables if they are marked as 'not closed properly' or 'crashed'.  If
this happens, MySQL will write an entry in the
<code>hostname.err</code> file <code>'Warning: Checking table ...'</code> which is
followed by <code>Warning: Repairing table</code> if the table needs to be
repaired.  If you get a lot of these errors, without <code>mysqld</code> having
died unexpectedly just before, then something is wrong and needs to
be investigated further. See section <A HREF="manual_MySQL_Database_Administration.html#Server_options">5.2.1  <code>mysqld</code> Command-Line Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
It's not a good sign if <code>mysqld</code> did died unexpectedly,
but in this case one shouldn't investigate the <code>Checking table...</code>
messages but instead try to find out why <code>mysqld</code> died.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Reproduceable_test_case" HREF="manual_toc.html#Reproduceable_test_case">E.1.6  Making a Test Case If You Experience Table Corruption</A></H3>

<P>
If you get corrupted tables or if <code>mysqld</code> always fails after some
update commands, you can test whether this bug is reproducible by doing the
following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Take down the MySQL daemon (with <code>mysqladmin shutdown</code>).
<LI>

Make a backup of the tables (to guard against the very unlikely case that
the repair will do something bad).
<LI>

Check all tables with <code>myisamchk -s database/*.MYI</code>.  Repair any
wrong tables with <code>myisamchk -r database/<var>table</var>.MYI</code>.
<LI>

Make a second backup of the tables.
<LI>

Remove (or move away) any old log files from the MySQL data
directory if you need more space.
<LI>

Start <code>mysqld</code> with <code>--log-bin</code>. See section <A HREF="manual_MySQL_Database_Administration.html#Binary_log">5.9.4  The Binary Log</A>.
If you want to find a query that crashes <code>mysqld</code>, you should use
<code>--log --log-bin</code>.
<LI>

When you have gotten a crashed table, stop the <code>mysqld server</code>.
<LI>

Restore the backup.
<LI>

Restart the <code>mysqld</code> server <strong>without</strong> <code>--log-bin</code>
<LI>

Re-execute the commands with <code>mysqlbinlog update-log-file | mysql</code>.
The update log is saved in the MySQL database directory with
the name <code>hostname-bin.#</code>.
<LI>

If the tables are corrupted again or you can get <code>mysqld</code> to die with the
above command, you have found reproducible bug that should be easy to
fix! FTP the tables and the binary log to
<a HREF="ftp://ftp.mysql.com/pub/mysql/upload/">ftp://ftp.mysql.com/pub/mysql/upload/</a> and enter it into
our bugs system at <a HREF="http://bugs.mysql.com/">http://bugs.mysql.com/</a>.
If you are a support customer, you can use the MySQL Customer Support Center
<a HREF="https://support.mysql.com/">https://support.mysql.com/</a> to alert the MySQL team about the
problem and have it fixed as soon as possible.

</UL>

<P>
You can also use the script <code>mysql_find_rows</code> to just execute some of the
update statements if you want to narrow down the problem.

<P>
To be able to debug a MySQL client with the integrated debug package,
you should configure MySQL with <code>--with-debug</code> or
<code>--with-debug=full</code>.
See section <A HREF="manual_Installing.html#configure_options">2.8.2  Typical <code>configure</code> Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX2403"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2404"></A>
Before running a client, you should set the <code>MYSQL_DEBUG</code> environment
variable:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; MYSQL_DEBUG=d:t:O,/tmp/client.trace
shell&#62; export MYSQL_DEBUG
</PRE>

<P>
This causes clients to generate a trace file in <tt>`/tmp/client.trace'</tt>.

</P>
<P>
If you have problems with your own client code, you should attempt to
connect to the server and run your query using a client that is known to
work.  Do this by running <code>mysql</code> in debugging mode (assuming that you
have compiled MySQL with debugging on):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --debug=d:t:O,/tmp/client.trace
</PRE>

If your client crashes at some 'legal' looking code, you should check
that your <tt>`mysql.h'</tt> include file matches your MySQL library file.
A very common mistake is to use an old <tt>`mysql.h'</tt> file from an old
MySQL installation with new MySQL library.

</P>
<P>
The MySQL server and most MySQL clients are compiled with the DBUG package
originally created by Fred Fish.  When you have configured MySQL for
debugging, this package makes it possible to get a trace file of what the
program is debugging.
See section <A HREF="manual_Porting.html#Making_trace_files">E.1.2  Creating Trace Files</A>.

</P>
<P>
This section summaries the argument values that you can specify in debug
options on the command line for MySQL programs that have been built with
debugging support. For more information about programming with the DBUG
package, see the DBUG manual in the <tt>`dbug'</tt> directory of MySQL source
distributions. It's best to use a recent distribution for MySQL 5.0 to get the
most updated DBUG manual.

</P>
<P>
You use the debug package by invoking a program with the
<code>--debug="..."</code> or the <code>-#...</code> option.

</P>
<P>
Most MySQL programs have a default debug string that will be
used if you don't specify an option to <code>--debug</code>.  The default
trace file is usually <code>/tmp/program_name.trace</code> on Unix and
<code>\program_name.trace</code> on Windows.

</P>
<P>
The debug control string is a sequence of colon-separated fields
as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
&#60;field_1&#62;:&#60;field_2&#62;:...:&#60;field_N&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
Each field consists of a mandatory flag character followed by
an optional <samp>`,'</samp> and comma-separated list of modifiers:

</P>

<PRE>
flag[,modifier,modifier,...,modifier]
</PRE>

<P>
The currently recognized flag characters are:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER>

<TR><TD><strong>Flag</strong> </TD><TD> <strong>Description</strong>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><code>d</code> </TD><TD> Enable output from DBUG_&#60;N&#62; macros for the current state. May be followed by a list of keywords which selects output only for the DBUG macros with that keyword. An empty list of keywords implies output for all macros.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><code>D</code> </TD><TD> Delay after each debugger output line. The argument is the number of tenths of seconds to delay, subject to machine capabilities. For example, <code>-#D,20</code> specifies a delay of two seconds.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><code>f</code> </TD><TD> Limit debugging and/or tracing, and profiling to the list of named functions.  Note that a null list disables all functions.   The appropriate <code>d</code> or <code>t</code> flags must still be given; this flag only limits their actions if they are enabled.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><code>F</code> </TD><TD> Identify the source file name for each line of debug or trace output.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><code>i</code> </TD><TD> Identify the process with the PID or thread ID for each line of debug or trace output.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><code>g</code> </TD><TD> Enable profiling.  Create a file called <tt>`dbugmon.out'</tt> containing information that can be used to profile the program.  May be followed by a list of keywords that select profiling only for the functions in that list.  A null list implies that all functions are considered.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><code>L</code> </TD><TD> Identify the source file line number for each line of debug or trace output.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><code>n</code> </TD><TD> Print the current function nesting depth for each line of debug or trace output.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><code>N</code> </TD><TD> Number each line of debug output.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><code>o</code> </TD><TD> Redirect the debugger output stream to the specified file.  The default output is <code>stderr</code>.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><code>O</code> </TD><TD> Like <code>o</code>, but the file is really flushed between each write. When needed, the file is closed and reopened between each write.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><code>p</code> </TD><TD> Limit debugger actions to specified processes. A process must be identified with the <code>DBUG_PROCESS</code> macro and match one in the list for debugger actions to occur.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><code>P</code> </TD><TD> Print the current process name for each line of debug or trace output.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><code>r</code> </TD><TD> When pushing a new state, do not inherit the previous state's function nesting level. Useful when the output is to start at the left margin.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><code>S</code> </TD><TD> Do function <code>_sanity(_file_,_line_)</code> at each debugged function until <code>_sanity()</code> returns something that differs from 0. (Mostly used with <code>safemalloc</code> to find memory leaks)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><code>t</code> </TD><TD> Enable function call/exit trace lines. May be followed by a list (containing only one modifier) giving a numeric maximum trace level, beyond which no output will occur for either debugging or tracing macros.  The default is a compile time option.

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Some examples of debug control strings that might appear on a shell command
line (the <code>-#</code> is typically used to introduce a control string to an
application program) are:

</P>

<PRE>
-#d:t
-#d:f,main,subr1:F:L:t,20
-#d,input,output,files:n
-#d:t:i:O,\\mysqld.trace
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL, common tags to print (with the <code>d</code> option) are
<code>enter</code>, <code>exit</code>, <code>error</code>, <code>warning</code>, <code>info</code>, and
<code>loop</code>.

<H2><A NAME="RTS-threads" HREF="manual_toc.html#RTS-threads">E.4  Comments about RTS Threads</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2406"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2407"></A>

</P>
<P>
I have tried to use the RTS thread packages with MySQL but
stumbled on the following problems:

</P>
<P>
They use old versions of many POSIX calls and it is very tedious to
make wrappers for all functions. I am inclined to think that it would
be easier to change the thread libraries to the newest POSIX
specification.

</P>
<P>
Some wrappers are already written. See <tt>`mysys/my_pthread.c'</tt> for more info.

</P>
<P>
At least the following should be changed:

</P>
<P>
<code>pthread_get_specific</code> should use one argument.
<code>sigwait</code> should take two arguments.
A lot of functions (at least <code>pthread_cond_wait</code>,
<code>pthread_cond_timedwait()</code>)
should return the error code on error. Now they return -1 and set <code>errno</code>.

</P>
<P>
Another problem is that user-level threads use the <code>ALRM</code> signal and this
aborts a lot of functions (<code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>open</code>...).
MySQL should do a retry on interrupt on all of these but it is
not that easy to verify it.

</P>
<P>
The biggest unsolved problem is the following:

</P>
<P>
To get thread-level alarms I changed <tt>`mysys/thr_alarm.c'</tt> to wait between
alarms with <code>pthread_cond_timedwait()</code>, but this aborts with error
<code>EINTR</code>.  I tried to debug the thread library as to why this happens,
but couldn't find any easy solution.

</P>
<P>
If someone wants to try MySQL with RTS threads I suggest the
following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Change functions MySQL uses from the thread library to POSIX.
This shouldn't take that long.
<LI>

Compile all libraries with the <code>-DHAVE_rts_threads</code>.
<LI>

Compile <code>thr_alarm</code>.
<LI>

If there are some small differences in the implementation, they may be fixed
by changing <tt>`my_pthread.h'</tt> and <tt>`my_pthread.c'</tt>.
<LI>

Run <code>thr_alarm</code>. If it runs without any ``warning,'' ``error,'' or aborted
messages, you are on the right track. Here is a successful run on
Solaris:

<PRE>
Main thread: 1
Thread 0 (5) started
Thread: 5  Waiting

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2408"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL is very dependent on the thread package used. So when
choosing a good platform for MySQL, the thread package is very
important.

</P>
<P>
There are at least three types of thread packages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

User threads in a single process. Thread switching is managed with
alarms and the threads library manages all non-thread-safe functions
with locks. Read, write and select operations are usually managed with a
thread-specific select that switches to another thread if the running
threads have to wait for data.  If the user thread packages are
integrated in the standard libs (FreeBSD and BSDI threads) the thread
package requires less overhead than thread packages that have to map all
unsafe calls (MIT-pthreads, FSU Pthreads and RTS threads).  In some
environments (for example, SCO), all system calls are thread-safe so the
mapping can be done very easily (FSU Pthreads on SCO).  Downside: All
mapped calls take a little time and it's quite tricky to be able to
handle all situations. There are usually also some system calls that are
not handled by the thread package (like MIT-pthreads and sockets). Thread
scheduling isn't always optimal.
<LI>

User threads in separate processes. Thread switching is done by the
kernel and all data are shared between threads.  The thread package
manages the standard thread calls to allow sharing data between threads.
LinuxThreads is using this method.  Downside: Lots of processes. Thread
creating is slow. If one thread dies the rest are usually left hanging
and you must kill them all before restarting. Thread switching is
somewhat expensive.
<LI>

Kernel threads. Thread switching is handled by the thread library or the
kernel and is very fast. Everything is done in one process, but on some
systems, <code>ps</code> may show the different threads. If one thread aborts, the
whole process aborts. Most system calls are thread-safe and should
require very little overhead.  Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and OSF/1 have kernel
threads.
</UL>

<P>
In some systems kernel threads are managed by integrating user
level threads in the system libraries. In such cases, the thread
switching can only be done by the thread library and the kernel isn't
really ``thread aware.''
