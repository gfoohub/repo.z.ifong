suppose we want to know whther weight vs height in this class is normal distrituted?
1. use regression analysis to see y=ax+b is ok 
	put all random daat (x,y)  into y=ax+b to get coefficent a and b
	check whether this line is ok (error samll or not)

2. if y=ax+b cannot be fitted then try y=ax^2+bx+c ...

there are only two variable in N.D. f(x)=1/... exp[..(x-u)^2] 
which are sd and mean


4 common models in distribution: bi-model (two peaks), norm dist, 
positive skew(right skew), negative skew(left skew)
if more data located in right side than it is a right skew(positive)


mean, median ,mode (most freq)

left skew (negative)	--> from left to right: mean, median, mode
right skew (positive)	--> from left to right: mode, median, mean
norm dist		--> mean, mode, median are located in the same place (middle)

how to calculate norm dist?
there are 70 students 

interval,midian,observed,fixi (expected value), fi*xi^2(second moment), expected freq, relative error

fixi: first moment
midiam^2 * freq: second moment

SS(varience) = first moment xxx second moment 
use 1st moment and 2nd moment you can calculate the SS
check text P379 find Z=2.32 --> 0.0102 upper tail


Z transform to normalized the norm dist,
Z=(X-u)/sd 
this will make u=0 and sd=1

p394
DF: degree of freedom

P395
(12,0.05) -> 21.02
check whether N.D. 
archvie square to whck the whole data is norm distributed
Text Book chap6 dn chap7 to examine the N.D. data distributed 

the norm dist map is smooth in perfect condition
real data dist won't be that smooth

type one error: arfa=0.05 (two tail, one tail)
if arfa=0.05 for two tails than left and right side has 0.025

(u-1.96sd , u+1.96sd) --> 95%
(u-2.576sd, u+2.576sd) -> 99%

null-hypothesis 接受否 ?
time-square 計算出之值若落在黑色( > 理論值) 則不是 N.D. 如在白色表示小於理論值則為 N.D.

type one error arfa = 0.01 (mean+2.576 sd) 信賴區間 99%

Z = (X-u)/sd (Z transform)
另一寫法為 N(0,1) 以下二者都是示 norm dist
mean=0, sd=1

example 7.1b 計算 sd of sucorse
mean=65 sd=25 則 65+25=90 應佔有 68%
100-68=32 把 32/2=16 所以求出來的數應 > 16%

P(Z>0.8)=0.2119 或 21.19% 
p378 0.8 時比大使用 upper tail 找到 0.2119

85 對稱於 45 因為 norm dist 所以 45 的也為 21.19%

第三小題則為  1-2*21.19%=0.5762

sample data 和 mother group 的 mean 應相同, 而
sd 則為差了根號n, sd=12/(9)^1/2=4.0
( 43, 47, 51 ) 應佔 68% 所以值 50 應 > 16%

p380 
2.9 	2.95
0.0019	0.0016

求 2.92 應為 0.0019 - (0.0019-0.0016) * 2/5 則為 0.00178
此為內插法
