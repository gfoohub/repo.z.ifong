# Install bind and bind-chroot packages

# Edit your /etc/sysconfig/named file.
Add the following line:
ROOTDIR="/var/named/chroot"

# Edit your /etc/named.conf file.
# Change the following line:
listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; };
-->
listen-on port 53 { any; };

This allows the bind daemon to listen on all your network IPs, not just your loopback(127.0.0.1) address.
Change this line:
allow-query     { localhost; };
to
allow-query     { 192.168.0.0/24; };

You now allow all the machines in your home LAN to use your DNS server.
Make sure it starts at boot time.

# chkconfig named on

Restart your DNS server.
# service named restart

now  you can try to use your own dns
# dig @192.168.0.10 google.com
