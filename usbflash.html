<h1>FreeBSD System on USB flash stick</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document describes the steps taken to put a full booting FreeBSD system on  
a USB flash disk, with the goal of setting up a group of identically-configured
machines that can be easily upgraded and maintained. The machines have an internal 
magnetic
disk (SATA RAID in my case, but it could be anything) that contains only application 
data and 
some web app code, with all system and third-party application software on the 
flash.</p>

<p>This document assumes a basic familiarity with the process of setting up a single 
FreeBSD
system and keeping it up to date. </p>

<p>I made extensive use of these URLs:

However, this document will go further in its attempt to provide for multiple

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
Installing and configuring FreeBSD is laudably simple, thanks to 
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysinstall&sektion=8">sysinstall</a>, 
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/net/cvsup/pkg-descr">cvsup</a>,
the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/">FreeBSD 
handbook</a> and the many ways to obtain the source. Upgrading a running
system's crucial software requires a few more steps: staying on top of 
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade/pkg-descr">
portupgrade</a>,
cvsuping ports and src and following the steps in <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/Makefile">/usr/src/Makefile</a> to build world
and kernel. But it's all fairly manageable.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that I've never found a simple way to keep multiple machines upgraded
at once.</p>

<h3>Problem area: system software</h3>
<p>The official source upgrade process in /usr/src/Makefile mandates
running 
'make installworld' after rebooting single user. Even if you run 'make world' once
and mount a common /usr/obj/, this entails taking every machine down separately and 
keeping it offline while the installworld completes.</p>

<h3>Problem area: third-party software (ports)</h3>
<p>Installing an upgraded port multiple times from the 
same mounted /usr/ports/ 
doesn't always work, because so many ports depend on touching parts of the /var/db and 
/etc/ trees. Even if it did work, the labor of running portupgrade or 
"make deinstall; make install" on multiple machines is frustrating and ultimately 
unsustainable.</p>

<h3>Problem summary</h3>
<p>Keeping src and third-party ports up to date on a set of machines 
is hard. Common mounted sources are a pain and they usually break.</p>

<p>What we need is a solution where we can do all the portupgrade and make world
interaction in one place, and then blast the resulting installed system
 onto multiple machines safely and cleanly,
with minimal downtimes and no risk of losing application data.</p>

<a name="why_usb" />
<h2>Why USB?</h2>

<p>The solution described here entails a separate booting storage volume with all system 
software enclosed within 
defined identical slices that can be duplicated entirely and then replicated 
machine-to-machine. Although this is possible using only internal magnetic disks in a
conventional system architecture, the rise of cheap, 2-gb-plus, BIOS-bootable, 
USB-connected flash storage devices makes everything a lot easier, especially initial
system setup.</p>

<p>
Booting off a USB slice makes the booting system discrete and separate from the permanent
data on the magnetic disk. You can have a "classic" partition setup with no 
intermixing of application data. With two slices set up, one inactive and one active, you 
can install an upgrade with only the reboot period as downtime, and roll back to the
 previous version of the entire system seamlessly if there is a problem.
All the while, your application data on the magnetic drive is never touched.</p>

<p>Although all this can be done remotely, should something go wrong the in-person
administration is extremely simple. The physical USB flash connected externally
makes it possible to literally pull the current system and install a new one much easier
than anything involving internal magnetic disks.</p>

<p>Additionally, it is much easier to standardize the USB disk than the magnetic disk.
It is easier to have a uniform slice image that the flash can boot from, while
potentially having slightly different RAID controllers and partition sizes from 
machine to machine.</p>  

<a name="materials" />
<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>Since we're going to be working with systems that have magnetic disks, this
document assumes you've got a <b>system with some sort of disk</b> and a <b>working 
FreeBSD install </b>up and running. You should have a <b>built world and kernel</b>
in the /usr/src/ tree on that system. 
We also assume you've got at least <b>one USB port</b>, a <b>BIOS that recognizes and can
 boot from USB
drives</b> (most modern BIOSes as of 8/2007 can), and several <b>USB flash disks of at 
least 2 gb</b>. 
The Cruzer from SanDisk is a popular model, but anything will probably work.</p>

<a name="init_flash" />
<h2>Initial Flash Setup</h2>

<a name="flash_slices" />
<h3>Slices</h3>

<p>We want a disk with two identical slices, each about 1 GB in size, that we can boot
from. Later we'll set up these from a script, but the first one we need to walk 
through.</p>

<p>First plug in your USB drive. You should see some console message about it being
recognized.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
# dmesg | tail -5
umass1: LEXAR JD Secure II +, rev 2.00/11.00, addr 3
da2 at umass-sim1 bus 1 target 0 lun 0
da2: <LEXAR JD Secure II + 1100> Removable Direct Access SCSI-0 device
da2: 40.000MB/s transfers
da2: 3840MB (7864320 512 byte sectors: 255H 63S/T 489C)
</pre>

<p>Depending on what your disk is recognized as, replace da2 below accordingly.
The first thing we need to do is blow away the factory layout of the flash disk
and install two identical FreeBSD slices. The easiest way to do this is by using
a prototype file for <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fdisk&sektion=8">
fdisk</a>. Just to review: In FreeBSD, slices are handled with fdisk.
A slice usually includes multiple partitions, which are handled with 
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bsdlabel&sektion=8">bsdlabel 
(disklabel)</a>. 
Most of the time you only
have one slice. Most of the time you have many partitions, which map to mountpoints 
(e.g. / or /usr) or are used for swap. 
</p>

<p>Here is our fdisk.proto file:</p>

<pre class="file">
#     slice     type    start   length
p       1       165     63      1991997
p       2       165     1992123 1991997
# set slice one active
a       1
</pre>

<p>The 63 sector offset at the top of the disk is to reserve space for booting 
code, and the 63 missing sectors between the slices preserves some kind of track
alignment so that the two slices can be identically sized. The legacy bootcode
stuff and the false geometry fakery (a flash drive is a long way from heads and
cylinders, in its real physical sense) is a big pain, but in general FreeBSD will
complain a little but work with reasonable settings.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
# fdisk -f fdisk.proto -i da2
</pre>

<p>This sets up our slices with one active, but to fully initialize the disk
we need to use <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=boot0cfg&sektion=8">
boot0cfg</a>.

<pre class="terminal">
# boot0cfg -o noupdate da2
</pre>

<p> The noupdate option keeps the MBR from writing itself back
after every boot, a minor precaution against flash abuse.
</p>

<pre class="terminal">
# boot0cfg -B da2
</pre>

<p>This installs the MBR code on the flash so we can have the standard
F1/F2 FreeBSD slice boot menu.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
# boot0cfg -s 1 da2
</pre>

<p>This makes sure we're booting off slice 1 the next time we boot this disk.</p>

<a name="flash_parts" />
<h3>Partitions</h3>

<p>Now we need to set up our initial flash with some partitions. We could in theory
just have one big partition, but since we're using 1-GB slices that's not a good idea.
FreeBSD doesn't like to boot off such a giant (by historical standards) partition, so 
we're going to divide each slice up into three partitions along traditional lines: 
/, /var and /usr. /var/run, /var/log, and /tmp will be handled by memory disks on the 
running system. Swap will be on the magnetic disk.
</p>

<p>The file flash_labels.proto:</p>

<pre class="file">
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize bps/cpg]
  a:   262144        0    4.2BSD     2048 16384 16392
  c:       *         0    unused        0     0      
  d:   163840        *    4.2BSD     2048 16384 10248
  e:       *         *    4.2BSD     2048 16384 28528
</pre>

<p>The '*' parameters are convenient wildcards that basically mean 
"do the right thing"
in the 'offset' column and "as much as possible" in the 'size' column.
Set up the partitions, <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=newfs&sektion=8">
newfs</a> them and <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mount&sektion=8">
mount</a> them somewhere. (Here we use /mnt.)
</p>

<pre class="terminal">
# bsdlabel -R da2s1 flash_labels.proto
# bsdlabel -B da2s1
# newfs -U da2s1a
# newfs -U da2s1d
# newfs -U da2s1e
# mount /dev/da2s1a /mnt
# mkdir /mnt/var
# mount /dev/da2s1d /mnt/var
# mkdir /mnt/usr
# mount /dev/da2s1e /mnt/usr
</pre>

<p>Don't worry about slice 2-- we'll deal with that later by duping s1's image.
All this laborious stuff is just to get the first valid slice up and running.
</p>

<a name="flash_system" />
<h3>System</h3>

<p>Now we need to install system software on this newly partitioned and formatted 
slice.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
# cd /usr/src
# make DESTDIR=/mnt installkernel
# make DESTDIR=/mnt installworld
</pre>

<p>
This doesn't install a full /etc hierarchy, so you'll
have to run this too:
</p>

<pre class="terminal">
# cd /usr/src/etc
# make DESTDIR=/mnt distrib-dirs
# make DESTDIR=/mnt distribution
</pre>

<a name="flash_config" />
<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>We need to get a few basic config file info on there before we can boot off the
USB. We need a skeletal /etc/fstab:</p>

<pre class="file">
/dev/da0s1a     /       ufs     rw,noatime      1       1
/dev/da0s1d     /var    ufs     rw,noatime      0       0
/dev/da0s1e     /usr    ufs     rw,noatime      0       0
md              /tmp    mfs     rw,-s24M,noatime        0       0
md              /var/run        mfs     rw,-s4M,noatime    0       0
md              /var/log        mfs     rw,-s32M,noatime   0       0
</pre>

<p>Note that this sets up our memory-disk volumes on three volatile parts of the 
disk. Although modern flash drives can handle a lot of writes, it's not a good idea to
have continual writes hitting them over the life of the system. If you need persistent
/var/run or /var/log info, map these somewhere on the magnetic disk. We'll see later on
how we devote a partition to app log info.</p>

<p>We also need a very skeletal /etc/rc.conf so the network comes up:</p>

<pre class="file">
hostname="host.domain.com"
ifconfig_nfe0="DHCP"
</pre>

<p>Substitute a hostname and the proper interface/network scheme that fits your
world.</p>

<p>At this point we could continue setting up the disk with chroot, but I think 
it's worthwhile to boot off the flash and make sure things are working. 
Reboot, and enter your BIOS setup to make sure it is set to boot off the USB HD 
first.</p>

<a name="flash_software" />
<h3>Third Party Software</h3>

<p>If the system boots up all right, mount your magnetic disk's /usr partition
somewhere, 
link up to your ports collection and install whatever ports you need.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
# mount /dev/da1s1e /mnt
# cd /usr
# ln -s /mnt/ports
# cd /usr/ports/shells/bash; make; make install
# [...]
</pre>

<p>
With 730 MB on the flash's /usr volume, you should be able to fit anything you need.
At this point, the flash-based system is running and ready to go. 
</p>
<p>There's a little bit of a chicken-and-egg problem for the next part-- we either
have to walk through setting up a magnetic disk before we finalize the flash image
and discuss upgrades, or assume the existence of a few subservient partitions 
that we conjure up out of thin air.
</p>

<p>This document is going to take the former path and deal with initializing and 
hooking in the magnetic disk, but if you want to do that all yourself you can skip
to <a href="#dupe_flash">Duplicating the Flash</a> below.</p>

<a name="init_disk" />
<h2>Initial magnetic disk setup</h2>

<p>For running systems within our new flash-booting setup, the magnetic disk
is going to be completely reserved for application code, data and logs. We're going
to blow away mostly all FreeBSD (or other OS) vestiges. That's the point-- the 
system boots off flash, so the internal disk is data only.</p>

<p>For that reason, it's advisable to perform these next steps on a different
machine than the one you've started working on. We'll call our original machine M1 and
the new one M2. Presumably you have at least two identical machines that you want
to keep upgraded.
</p>

<p>Now that you've booted on M2, whose internal disk contents are
worthless, we can begin.</p>

<p>For my application, I'm setting up a big swap partition, one fs partition that 
uses 10% of remaining space (for web-app code, a few homedirs, etc.) and a giant
partition that uses the remainder.</p>

<p>The file internal_labels.proto looks like this:</p>
<pre class="file">
# a is small and unused
# b is swap
# d is where we put our app code, homedirs, ports,
#   system src, anything we need. 10% is a little generous.
# e is the rest of the disk. It mounts on /usr/local/var and holds
#   all the growable data-- app data and logs.
#
#8 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize bps/cpg]

  a:  1048576        0    4.2BSD        0     0     0
  b:  30G            *    swap
  c:  *              0    unused        0     0         # "raw" part, don't edit
  d:  10%            *    4.2BSD     2048 16384 28528
  e:  *              *    4.2BSD     2048 16384 28528
</pre>

<p>The initializion script init_disk.sh looks like this:</p>
<pre class="file">
#!/bin/sh -x
#

DISK=${DISK:-da1}

# Initialize the disk with one all-encompassing FreeBSD slice
#
fdisk -I ${DISK}

# Initialize partitions from prototype file
#
bsdlabel -R ${DISK}s1 internal_labels.proto

newfs -U ${DISK}s1d
newfs -U ${DISK}s1e

# mount the new vols and do app-specific setup
</pre>

<p>It respects the environment variable DISK in case da1 is not it.</p>

<p>After the newfs commands are complete, you can mount
the new filesystems where you want and do whatever app-specific setup is
needed. Extend the script as neccessary.</p>

<p>In my case, the new volumes are mounted on /usr/local/pd2 and /usr/local/var, 
neccessitating the following additions to /etc/fstab:
</p>
<pre class="file">
/dev/da1s1b     none    swap    sw      0       0
/dev/da1s1d     /usr/local/pd2  ufs     rw      0       0
/dev/da1s1e     /usr/local/var  ufs     rw,noatime      0       0
</pre>

<p>Note that because I'm using SATA RAID for my internal disk, I've assumed
da1 as the disk's device name. If you use a plain SATA disk/controller you
might use ad1 or ad4.</p>

<a name="dupe_flash" />
<h2>Duplicating the Flash</h2>


<p>Now we have a booting slice that lives on a USB flash with another slice
available, as well as a script to initialize the internal disk on new machines
and at least one machine so initialized (M2), as well as our first machine which
still has a bootable internal disk (M1).</p>

<a name="dupe_first_time" />
<h3>The First Time</h3>
<p>For this first time, we need to boot off that original internal disk on M1.</p>

<p>The reason is that we need to boot off something other than our flash if 
we're going to duplicate that flash, since we need the entire image to be
completely quiescent. If the filesystems are open we'll be duplicating an open
filesystem, which will look like a crashed filesystem whenever we reboot.</p>

<a name="dupe_subs_times" />
<h3>All subsequent times</h3>
<p>Once we have flash disks with two working slices on them, we can finalize the new
image on s1, then boot off the other slice, then duplicate s1's image.</p> 

<p>We switch booting slices with the script swap_boot.sh:</p>
<pre class="file">
#!/bin/sh -x
#
# Shell script that swaps which slice will boot the flash.
# Takes an argument: 1 or 2. Relies on the DISK variable,
# which can be set but defaults to da0.

DISK=${DISK:-da0}
fdisk -f ./active_slice.$1 ${DISK}
boot0cfg -s $1 ${DISK}
</pre>

<p>This runs fdisk and boot0cfg to switch the default booting slice. It
relies on two dummy fdisk prototype files, active_slice.1 and active_slice.2:</p>

<pre class="file">
# dummy prototype to set slice 1 to active
a 1
</pre>

<pre class="file">
# dummy prototype to set slice 2 to active
a 2
</pre>

<p>Since all that is required in these files is a line with 'a' and a number,
the script should probably be improved to create them on the fly automatically.
</p>

<a name="dupe_common" />
<h3>Common steps</h3>

<p>After we boot, copy off the image of the non-booting flash slice using 
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dd&sektion=1">dd</a>
on the /dev/ special file:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
# dd if=/dev/da2s1 of=FLASH_SLICE_1 bs=32768
</pre>

<p>This flash image can now serve as our source image for all the other machines
we need to create, or, in the future, update. The basic command to write this
image to a flash is the reverse of the above:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
dd if=FLASH_SLICE_1 of=/dev/da2s2 bs=32768
</pre>

<p>It is intended to work as part of these two scripts. First, init_flash.sh,
for when you've got a completely new flash:</p>

<pre class="file">
#!/bin/sh -x
#
DISK=${DISK:-da2}

/usr/sbin/boot0cfg -B ${DISK}

/usr/sbin/boot0cfg -o noupdate ${DISK}

/sbin/fdisk -f fdisk.proto -i ${DISK}

/usr/sbin/boot0cfg -B ${DISK}

./update_flash_slice.sh
</pre>

<p>That performs the basic steps that are explained above and then calls
update_flash_slice.sh:</p>

<pre class="file">
#!/bin/sh
#
if [ -z ${SLICE_SRC} ] ; then
    echo "must set SLICE_SRC for slice source file"
    exit 1
fi
if [ -z ${SLICE_DST} ] ; then
    echo "must set SLICE_DST with number of slice to write"
    exit 1
fi
DISK=${DISK:-da2}

dd if=${SLICE_SRC} of=/dev/${DISK}s${SLICE_DST} bs=32768
</pre>

<p>That enforces the exact definition of the source file and the target
slice and performs the dd. Example usage (in bash):</p>

<pre class="terminal">
# SLICE_SRC=./FLASH_SLICE_1 SLICE_DEST=2 DISK=da2 \
 ./update_flash_slice.sh
</pre>

<a name="config_duped_slice" />
<h2>Configuring the duplicated flash slice</h2>

<p>Once the duplication is complete, you'll want to mount the new slice briefly
and at least change the hostname in /etc/rc.conf and fix /etc/fstab if 
the target slice was s2, since our initial /etc/fstab assumes s1.

<pre class="terminal">
# mount /dev/da2s2a /mnt
</pre>

<p>Here is an example top of an /etc/fstab file for a slice 2 install:</p>

<pre class="file">
/dev/da0s2a     /       ufs     rw,noatime      1       1
/dev/da0s2d     /var    ufs     rw,noatime      0       0
/dev/da0s2e     /usr    ufs     rw,noatime      0       0
</pre>

<p>If this was all that was needed, you could extend the update_flash_slice.sh script
to take care of this.</p>

<a name="upgrade" />
<h2>Upgrading a running system</h2>

<p>Once we make a new flash image on M1, for instance after an upgrade, we can put
the tools together to upgrade running systems with the only downtime being the reboot.
Assume that M1 is our seed machine, and we've created a flash image using dd as above 
and it resides in /usr/local/var.</p>

<p>Assume we have another machine, M3, that we want to upgrade. First we
scp the image over onto M3's internal disk:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
# scp M1:/usr/local/var/FLASH_SRC.NEW /usr/local/var/
</pre>

<p>Then we copy it onto whatever slice is inactive, 
make whatever edits are needed, swap the booting information and reboot:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
# SLICE_SRC=/usr/local/var/FLASH_SRC.NEW SLICE_DEST=2 DISK=da0 \
 ./update_flash_slice.sh
# mount /dev/da0s2a /mnt
# [edit /mnt/etc/fstab and /mnt/etc/rc.conf if needed]
# ./swap_boot.sh 2
# reboot
</pre>

<a name="summary" />
<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Although this process may seem complicated, it eliminates repetition of complex jobs
over the life of the running systems.</p>

<p>Initializing all the machines happens one time, when they are first 
brought up. It consists only of booting off the flash and initializing the
internal disk-- no software installs.</p>

<p>All "system building" software installs and subsequent upgrades are done once,
on one machine. When you have a satisfactory build you dupe that flash slice
and copy it all around. Recurring jobs are cut to the bone and keeping many machines
up to date and identical is easy.</p>
