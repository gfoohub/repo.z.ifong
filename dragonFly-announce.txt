This is MaheshaDragonFlyBSD, a modular CD(USB) distro. 
It can be easily put onto a  CD. Vkernel  is  prebuilt  for you in 
/myinstall/vkernel directory.

To use network, type dhclient nic  and replace "nic" with your real network
card. 
To start the simple  icewm  desktop,  type startx  or startxaut.  
Run /makeiso to make the ISO image from this thing, but you must have a DVD, as
this  BSD  takes about 1 GB of space (first mount a partition to /mnt4 from
within the MaheshaDragonFlyBSD environment.This thing does not use swap, so
expect it will be slower. 

Press Alt+F2 to  switch  between  consoles.  This
thing has a nice console file manager - Midnight Commander, so  type mc  to
use it. If you want to hear audio, you must first load the sound  driver  -
type kldload snd_driver. This thing  supports  text  to  speech  conversion
(espeak), is mounted read-only with a few dirs in memory  (/etc,  /var...).

You  may  remount  this  thing  read-write  anytime  and  install packages:
mount /dev/da8s1a /
Enjoy BSD!
