modfiy login ID (this is the ONLY thing you need to do) at 874 can save $89
check his orig file at ./20150413.garden.friend.orig.backupsettings.conf

modify WiFi setting login cht chtsvdsl then Hinet Wifi On! 
(note: use just hinet offer web GUI, no need to backup to download 2 pc then vi setting.conf then restore)

2015/04/14 20150413.garden.friend.orig.backupsettings.conf does not work on soekirs
why? P874 login id is 12345678@wifi.hinet.net, soekris cannot talk to P874

2015/04/18 check those 2 20150419* file

login as supervisor: backup conf
login as user: modify 12345678@wifi.hinet.net --> real_id@hinet.net then keyin passwd
then pc can goto internet without auth, and soekris WORK!! 

after modify login ID, wifi OK, no need to pay $89 monthly fee to hinet --> happy
