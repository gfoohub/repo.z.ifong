vigor 2910 default LAN ip is 192.168.1.1 
one can reset (long press small button at the back) to  DEFAULT 192.168.1.1 and EMPTY:EMPTY

since hinet zyxel is 192.168.1.  i move vigor to 192.168.2.1

and i want to use mac+imbx31+soekris in this HUB (note: use it as hub, without dhcpd 
becase ibm x31 is pxe dhcpd and let soekris to boot from x31)

hard set mac to 192.168.2.11
x31 192.168.2.100
